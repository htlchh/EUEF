get
on

its
course
and
I
came
to
the
same
conclusion

The

involved
115
people
with

levels
.

They
were
given
900
milligrams
a
day
of
dried
garlic
powder

their

measured

But

said
either
previous

have
been
interpreted
incorrectly
,
those
taking

were
not

the

,
an
increase
of
eight
percent
on
its
$
486.5
million
valuation
a
year
earlier
.

The
company
said
the
increase
reflected
the
value
of
extensions
to
the
network
to
meet
economic
growth
in
its
supply
area
and
an
increase
in
the
estimated
lifespan
of
the
network
.

It
said
the
increase
was
consistent
with
the
approach
followed
by
other
power
companies
and
reflected
the
company
's
new
levels
of
preventative
maintenance
and
equipment

.

The

was

,
"
I
never
really
got
a
chance
to
play
because
he
was
serving
big
and
getting
in
close
to
the
net
.

"
He
was
also
able
to
handle
my
serve
pretty
easily
because
my
(
first
)
service
percentage
was
only
in
the
40s
.

Put
those
two
things
together
and
you
get
a
loss

missed
10
weeks
after
wrist
surgery
earlier
this

the
time
away
from
tennis
has
given
him
a
new
perspective
.

"
Before
when
I
was
on
tour
,
I
always
felt
I
had
to
be
in
bed
by
9:30
or
10
o'clock
and
I
had
to
be
up
at
a
certain
time

"

Now
I
can
go
to

at
at
midnight
or
wake
up
at
seven
in
the
morning
.

I
just
do
n't
have
as
many
set

it

his
first
in
five
meetings
with
the
11th-ranked
Frenchman	B	Frenchman	--NME--
.
"

It
's
always
difficult
to
win
a
match
when
you
lose
the
first
set
,
especially
against
someone
you
have
never
beaten
,
"
he
said
.

"
I
got
more
aggressive
in
the
second
and
third
sets
and
the
wind
picked
up
and
that
also
affected
things
because

went
off
a

bit

He

the

at

.

He

caps

after
the

due
to
the
fact
these

took

by

"
Volatility
has
a
bid
to
it
--
longer-dated
volatility
more
than
short-dated
because
the
event
people
were
buying
for
has
passed
and
now
perhaps
people
will
sell
some
short
dated
vol
and
buy
some
long
dated
vol
,
"
he
said
.

"
Long
dated
volatility
has
been
low
this
year
,
so
it
is
still
at
levels
which
are
not
historically
high
.

"
It
is
not
a
dangerous
level
to
own
vol.
You
are
not
going
to
lose
a
lot
and
you
could
make
quite

in

,
it
should

He
said
the
absence

of
many
market
makers
was
a
main
factor
behind
falls
this
week
in
volatility
in
high-yielding
markets
such
as

Coughlan	B	Coughlan	--NME--
said
the
market
had
more
downside
than
upside
potential
,
but
a
fall
was
not
likely
to
be
of
significant
size
.

"
I
recommend
people
sell

in

so
I
would
use
current
the
low

"
So
sell

next

after
persistently
trailing
her
on

In

the

said
that

Stenning	B	Stenning	--NME--

close
that
he
twice
smashed

pushed

According

from

,

"
As

Wisconsin	B	Wisconsin	Wisconsin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin	33127

"
Thompson	B	Thompson	Tommy_Thompson	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Thompson	217709
said

Still
,
the
governor
said
the
new
law
does
not
go
as
far
as
the
state
's
own
welfare
reform
program
,
dubbed
W-2	B	W-2	--NME--
.

He
said
that
despite
the
new
law
,
Wisconsin	B	Wisconsin	Wisconsin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin	33127
will
still
require
federal
waivers
allowing
the
working
poor
to
acquire
health
care
coverage
from
the
state
,
a
60-day
residency
requirement
for
participation
in
the
welfare
program
,
and
child
support
collections
to
go
directly
to
custodial
parents
.

The
nation
's
new
welfare
reform
law
limits
eligibility
,
gives
states
more
power
and
ends
direct
federal
aid
for
poor
children

100,000

of

held

China	B	China	People\u0027s_Republic_of_China	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China	5405
's
strategic
state
reserve
,
industry
sources
said
on
Friday
.

Around
40,000
tonnes
of
the
copper
have
already
been
moved
to
warehouses
near
the
northern
port
of
Yingkou	B	Yingkou	Yingkou	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yingkou	1331885
,
where
some
of
the
strategic
stockpile
was
stored
,
they
said
.

Just
who
owns
the
copper
is
a
question
that
has
kept
traders
and
industry
analysts
guessing
since
the
metal
was
channelled
into
Shanghai	B	Shanghai	Shanghai	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai	27643
by
the
China	B	China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp	--NME--

Corp	I	China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp	--NME--
(
CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--
)
in
June
and
July
.

It
was
unclear
whether
or
not
the
40,000
tonnes
had
cleared
customs
--
which
would
provide
some
concrete
indication
that
the
strategic
reserve
,
administered
directly
by
the
central
government
's
State	B	State Planning Commission	--NME--
Planning	I	State Planning Commission	--NME--
Commission	I	State Planning Commission	--NME--
,
owned
the
copper
.

Traders
have
said
the
reserve
could
negotiate
concessions
on
duties
--
three
percent
import
tax
and
17
percent
value-added
tax
--
that
made
the
copper
prohibitively
expensive
otherwise
.

But
one
source
,
the
head
of
a
Hong	B	Hong Kong	Hong_Kong	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong	13404
Kong	I	Hong Kong	Hong_Kong	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong	13404
trading
house
,
said
it
made
no
difference
if
the
copper
was
customs
cleared
or
not
.

"
If
they
spend
all
this
money
moving
the
copper
to
Yingkou	B	Yingkou	Yingkou	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yingkou	1331885
,
it
will
be
sitting
there
for
years
,
"
he
said
.

"
Once
it
arrives
in
Yingkou	B	Yingkou	Yingkou	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yingkou	1331885
,
it
is
subject
to
monitoring
by
the
State	B	State Planning Commission	--NME--
Planning	I	State Planning Commission	--NME--
Commission	I	State Planning Commission	--NME--
,
which
has
to
give
permission
for
any
more
movement
;
it
is
out
of
the
hands
of
traders
,
"
he
said
.

Mystery
has
surrounded
the
Shanghai	B	Shanghai	Shanghai	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai	27643
stockpile
in
recent
months
,
with
traders
unsure
not
only
of
who
owns
it
,
but
of
its
exact
size
and
what
its
owner
planned
to
do
with
it
.

Trading
sources
generally
agreed
it
would
be
cost-effective
to
take
the
copper
back
into
a
depleted
central
reserve
as
it
had
already
served
its
purpose
in
taking
advantage
of
long-term
backwardation
on
the
London	B	London Metal Exchange	London_Metal_Exchange	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metal_Exchange	223968
Metal	I	London Metal Exchange	London_Metal_Exchange	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metal_Exchange	223968
Exchange	I	London Metal Exchange	London_Metal_Exchange	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metal_Exchange	223968
(
LME	B	LME	--NME--
)
.

A
backwardation
occurs
when
the
spot
price
of
a
metal
is
higher
than
the
forward
price
.

CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--
lent
around
85,000
tonnes
of
copper
onto
the
LME	B	LME	--NME--
between
April
and
June
1995
on
behalf
of
the
state
reserve
,
running
the
state
stockpile
down
to
115,000
tonnes
from
200,000
tonnes
previously
.

Traders
in
Asia	B	Asia	Asia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia	689
said
CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--
could
well
have
lent
it
to
the
market
at
around
US$	B	US$	United_States_dollar	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar	18717338
2,700
a
tonne
,
and
then
paid
somewhere
between
$
2,200
and
$
2,400
a
tonne
when
it
started
taking
the
metal
back
earlier
this
year
.

This
would
have
cleared
CNIEC	B	CNIEC	--NME--
a
healthy
profit
,
which
could
then
have
been
used
to
finance
storage
and
other
costs
.

offered

they

.

They
reported

that
were
probably

.

They
also
expressed
concern
that
the
tonnage
in
bonded
warehouses
would
move
onto
the
domestic
market
.

But
these
concerns
were
irrelevant
,
a
Singapore	B	Singapore	Singapore	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore	27318

said
,
despite
a
forecast
that

copper
demand
could
hit
one

tonnes
this
year
.

As
with

,
"
there
is
a
desire
(
by

government
)
to

,
"
he

you
keep
it
in

"
a

"
Sixty

go

said

,
creation

was
underway

Now
,
60
days
later
,
he
had
a
chance
to
talk
about
it
again
.

It
is
an
example
of

strategic
planning
as
he
heads
into

are

game
.

In

Clinton	B	Clinton	Bill_Clinton	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton	3356
signed
into

an
increase

a

that
makes
it

well

"

Although

decline
to
say
just
what
each

will
be
,
the
intent
is
to
put
a

himself
and
not
just
those

on

paedophile

been
seized

some
of

Dutroux	B	Dutroux	Marc_Dutroux	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux	154694

led

to
the
bodies

At

part
of

in

of
high-level
protection
for
Dutroux	B	Dutroux	Marc_Dutroux	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux	154694

his

is
based
on
leaked

cataloguing
a
high
degree
of

bungling
,
incompetence
and
indifference

Among
the
revelations
are
the
fact
that
the
gendarmerie
was
running
a
surveillance
operation
codenamed
"
Othello	B	Othello	--NME--

against
Dutroux	B	Dutroux	Marc_Dutroux	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux	154694

and
Melissa	B	Melissa	--NME--
and
An	B	An	--NME--
and
Eefje	B	Eefje	--NME--
were
kidnapped

They
show
that
the
gendarmes
were
aware
that
Dutroux	B	Dutroux	Marc_Dutroux	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux	154694
was
building
cells
in
some
of

houses
for
holding
children
,

this
information
was
either
not
passed
on
to

police
forces

the
missing
girls
or
was
overlooked

it
was

They
also
show
that

A

,
dropped
as
a
disciplinary
measure
after
arriving
only
35
minutes

as
the
touring
team
batted

to

for
five
at
the
interval
,

lead
of
87
.

Currin	I	Brian Currin	Brian_Currin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Currin	14059389
said
the
hearings
last
week
were
not
intended
as
a
form
of
confessional
and
that
those
who
personally
committed
crimes
during
apartheid
would
testify
only
before
a
separate
arm
of
the
commission
,
the
amnesty
committee
.

"
I
do
n't
think
one
should
have
expected
more
than
what
one
got
,
"
he
said
.
"

That
was
not
the
amnesty
committee
where
perpetrators
are
expected
to
open
their
hearts
and
souls
and
to
tell
it
all
.
"

The
commission
,
which
has
the
power
to
grant
amnesty
to
those
who
confess
to
abuses
,
has
begun
hearing
the
testimony
from
people
already
in
jail
for
their
deeds
.

But

,
such
as

's
deputy

,
Alex	B	Alex Boraine	--NME--
Boraine	I	Alex Boraine	--NME--
,
told
reporters
the
commission
would
begin
issuing
subpoenas
to
suspects
who
refused
to
appear
voluntarily
some
time
this
week
.

He
added
that

Botha	I	P.W. Botha	P\u002e_W\u002e_Botha	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._W._Botha	383252
could
be
among
those
called
.

But
Currin	B	Currin	Brian_Currin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Currin	14059389
,
who
is
advising
several
people
regarded
as
perpetrators
,
said
this
was
not
the
best
way
to
achieve
the
commission
's
aims
.

"
A
person
can
be
forced
to
appear
,
but
the
only
way
one
is
going
to
get
to
the
truth
in
its
totality
is
if
people
feel
it
is
a
good
idea
to
go
to
the
amnesty
committee
.

At
the
moment
this
is
not
the
case
.
"

He
cited
Coetzee	B	Coetzee	Dirk_Coetzee	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Coetzee	11288911
,
who
was
charged
with
murder
after
confessing
in
media
interviews
to
dirty
tricks
.

His
trial
is
due
to
start
in
December
but
the
truth
commission
intends
to
decide
on
his
amnesty
application
before
that
.

Currin	B	Currin	Brian_Currin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Currin	14059389
said
the
law
had
to
be
changed
so
all
judicial
prosecutions
were
automatically
suspended
for
those
who
approached
the
truth
commission

Corporate
America	B	America	United_States	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	3434750
is
planning
major
changes
in
employee
compensation
in
the
next
few
years
,
according
to
a
recent
study
.

What
it
comes
down
to
is
this
:
If
you
're
highly
skilled
,
you
'll
benefit
nicely
.

But
if
you
're
not
and
cannot
contribute
to
your
employer
's
goals
,
you
'll
be
paid
less
.

The
survey
,
conducted
in
late
1995
and
the
early
part
of
this
year
by
management
consulting
firm
Towers	B	Towers Perrin	Towers_Perrin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_Perrin	8706816
Perrin	I	Towers Perrin	Towers_Perrin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_Perrin	8706816
,
showed
that
the
focus
will
be
on
an
employee
's
overall
value
to
the
company
's
bottom
line
--
rather
than
how
well
an
employee
performs
a
specific
task
.

Presently
,
for
example
,
if
an
accountant
's
job
involves
doing
five
specific
tasks
,
he
or
she
can
expect
a
certain
salary
,
said
Sandra	B	Sandra O'Neal	--NME--
O'Neal	I	Sandra O'Neal	--NME--
,

Perrin	I	Towers Perrin	Towers_Perrin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_Perrin	8706816
principal
.

In
the
future
,
the
accountant
will
be
evaluated
solely
on
"
knowledge
,
skill
and
abilities
,
"
she
said
.

In
addition
to
using
accounting
skills
,
the
accountant
will
also
have
to
be
creative
,
work
well
in
a
team
,
be
sensitive
to
customer
needs
and
set
productivity
goals
.

"
The
good
news
is
,
if
you
're
highly
skilled
and
have
many
abilities
,
you
'll
be
paid
more
,
"
said
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--
.

"
The
bad
news
is
,
if
you
're
not
skilled
and
ca
n't
contribute
to
a
team
,
to
customer
service
and
the
organisation
's
goals
,
you
'll
be
paid
less
.
"

Of
the
750
mid-to-large
size
corporations
surveyed
,
81
percent
had
undergone
a
major
restructuring
in
the
last
three
years
,
and
more
than
two-thirds
reported
that
productivity
and
profits
were
up
as
result
.

Next
on
the
agenda
for
these
firms
is
developing
a
new
compensation
structure
,
and
78
percent
report
that
they
are
considering
a
new
,
skills-based
plan
for
both
management
and
non-management
employees
.

This
coming
shift
,
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--
said
,
"
is
not
just
isolated
or
a
fad
.

It
's
an
inexorable
change
.
"

After
World	B	World War II	World_War_II	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	32927
War	I	World War II	World_War_II	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	32927
II	I	World War II	World_War_II	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	32927
,
corporations
adopted
a
"
military
model
"
creating
hierarchical
organisations
where
"
the
concept
of
defined
tasks
worked
great
,
"
she
said
.

But
as
the
economy
became
global
,
customers
were
more
demanding
and
problems
became
more
complex
.

"
Multi-layers
kept
management
at
a
distance
from
its
customers
,
"
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--
said
.

Now
organisations
must
change
to
stay
competitive
.

O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--
says
firms
will
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
teams
and
team
performance
in
giving
raises
.

If
your
team
does
well
,
you
'll
do
well
.

If
it
does
n't
do
well
,
do
n't
expect
a
raise
.

Is
this
fair
to
an
employee
who
can
go
the
distance
but
is
on
a
team
that
ca
n't
keep
up
?

"
That
's
an
important
question
we
used
to
ask
a
lot
,
"
said
O'Neal	B	O'Neal	--NME--
.
"

It
's
not
a
question
we
ask
any
more
.

The
more
important
question
is
--
'
Do
we
have
results
?
'

"

To
get
those
results
,
27
percent
of
the
companies
surveyed
plan
to
eliminate
base
pay
increases
in
favour
of
cash
bonuses
and
incentives
,
such
as
employee
and
team
award
programmes
and
education
.

Companies
that
can
change
their
culture
and
view
employees
as
business
partners
will
do

to
fall
by
more

percent

two

factors

to

A

scoured
the

Borsuk	B	Borsuk	--NME--
said
the
lack
of
cash
in
Ukraine	B	Ukraine	Ukraine	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine	31750
's
agricultural
sector
is
as
bad
as
the
drought
.

Collective
farms
and
Ukraine	B	Ukraine	Ukraine	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine	31750
's
nascent
private
farming
sector
have
no
money
for
fertiliser
,
no
money
for
herbicides
and
pesticides
,
no
money
to
repair
old
or
buy
new
machinery
,
no
money
for
fuel
,
and
none
to
buy
good
seed
.

This
year
's
harvest
is
down
from
last
year
's
36.5
million
tonne
harvest
,
which
in
turn
compares
with
50
million
tonnes
in
1990
,
the
year
before
independence
.

The
decline
is
all
the
worse
for
people
who
recall
wasteful
Soviet	B	Soviet	Soviet_Union	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union	26779
times
,
when
the
Kremlin	B	Kremlin	Moscow_Kremlin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin	381075
imported
grain
but
priced
bread
so
cheaply
that
people
bought
it
to
feed
their
pigs
.

"
Agriculture
is
very
expensive
,
and
there
are
no
solutions
to
our
problems
on
the
horizon
,
"
said
Odnosum	B	Odnosum	--NME--
.

He
said
his
farm
,
its
260
workers
now
readying
the
fields
for
winter
wheat
sowing
,
expected
the
land
to
yield
5.2
tonnes
per
hectare
(
2.5
acres
)
but
ended
up
with
3.9
tonnes
--
still
better
than
the
national
average
of
2.11
tonnes
per
hectare
this
year
.

"
We
did
not
have
money
for
fertiliser
,
we
're
in
debt
for
fuel
,
and
we
're
borrowing
diesel
,

Soprun	B	Soprun	--NME--
said
.
"

People
are
working
out
of
their

"

Borsuk	B	Borsuk	--NME--
said
the
farm
sector
has
two
options
:
"
We
can
sit
down
and
cry
,
or
we
can
do
something
.
"

He
said
the
government
plans
to
increase
the
sowing
of
the
winter
wheat
which
will
be
harvested
next
year
.

Planted
in
late
summer
and
early
autumn
,
the
grain
is
Ukraine	B	Ukraine	Ukraine	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine	31750
's
largest
export
item
and
traditionally
grows
better
than
summer
wheat
in
Ukraine	B	Ukraine	Ukraine	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine	31750
's
soil
.

Further
plans
,
he
said
,
called
for
full
provision
of
resources
like
fertiliser
and
herbicides
for
25
percent
of
Ukraine	B	Ukraine	Ukraine	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine	31750
's
arable
land
next
year
,
for
50
percent
in
1998
and
100
percent
of
the
land
in
1999
.

"
If
we
follow
this
we
'll
be
able
to
sell
10
million
tonnes
of
grain
by
the
year
2000
,
"
Borkus	B	Borkus	--NME--
said
.

The
government
has
been
trying
to
phase
out
huge
subsidies
to
the
farm
sector
,
and
in
a
move
back
to
pre-Soviet	B	pre-Soviet	--NME--
days
has
given
up
to
50
hectares
(
124
acres
)
of
land
to
some
36,000
private
farmers
willing
to
go
it
alone
.

Collective
farms
will
last
for
the
next
few
years
,
because
most
private
farms
now
only
produce
enough
to
feed
themselves
with
maybe
a
little
extra
to
sell
,
said
one
private
farmer
:
"
In
the
future
,
maybe
,
but
it
's
better
not
to
hurry
.

"
Collectivisation
brought
us
a
lot
of
pain
.

And
it
went
too
fast
.

Privatising
too
quickly
can
also
have
a
negative
outcome

Happily

"
Not

We

substantial

The
most

one
with

but
it
suffered

due
to

last
August
.

The

But
Gilbertson	B	Gilbertson	--NME--

Looking
ahead
to
the

,
he
said
that
Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--

"
Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--

soundly

for

had
pruned

"

leaving

"
Gilbertson	B	Gilbertson	--NME--
said
.

He
added
that
the
group
still
had
about
85
million
rand
after
tax
invested
in
various
shares
,
which
were
market
for
disposal
when
required
.

Referring
to
Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--
's
increased
41.5
percent
stake
in
Ingwe	B	Ingwe	--NME--
,
Gilbertson	B	Gilbertson	--NME--
said
the
group
would
wait
for
coal
shares
to
be
cheaper
before
considering
snapping
up
more
.

"
I
think
we
would
have
liked
to
have
more
of
Ingwe	B	Ingwe	--NME--
but
it
's
the
question
of
adding
value
.

When
we
bought
the
shares
we
bought
...

at
quite
a
bit
lower
than
the
price
is
now
...

maybe
if
we
just
wait
another
few
years
for
the
next
downturn
in
coal
.
"

Finally
,
Gilbertson	B	Gilbertson	--NME--
said
a

Gencor	B	Gencor	--NME--

Maybe
they

be
alcoholics

"
Perry	B	Perry	--NME--
joked
before
lifting
her
glass

Fans

be
shelling
out
$

And
that

Make

Even
a
sandwich
as
pedestrian
as
a
ham
and
swiss

is
going
for
a
whopping
$
8.00
.

Of
course
,
it
is
served
on
a

It
must
be
the
cost

about
the
unfairness
of

,
not
seeded
here
for
the
first
time
since
1990
,
might
have
benefitted
from
some
fiddling

himself
after

Ranked
18th
in
the
world
,
Stich	B	Stich	Michael_Stich	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stich	979088

who
is
16th

had
never
been
played
in
the
Open	B	Open	--NME--
and
had
been
left
out
of

originally
.

But
Stich	B	Stich	Michael_Stich	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stich	979088
did
n't
want
to
play
that
game
.

"
I
think
he
deserves
to
be
seeded
as
everybody
else
who
is
in
the
top
16
deserves
to
be

in

when

Lebed	B	Lebed	Alexander_Lebed	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed	431579

pledging
to

work

then
he
apparently
thought

Speculation
mounted
last

that
Lebed	B	Lebed	Alexander_Lebed	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed	431579
was
operating
out
on
a
limb
in
Chechnya	B	Chechnya	Chechnya	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya	6095
as
Yeltsin	B	Yeltsin	Boris_Yeltsin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin	23278520
,
hardly
seen
since
his
reelection
last
month
,
kept
out
of
sight
and
then
gave
an
interview
criticising
his
envoy
just
as
he
clinched
a
truce
.

But
Chernomyrdin	B	Chernomyrdin	Viktor_Chernomyrdin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Chernomyrdin	482420
took
pains
at
the
weekend
to
insist
Lebed	B	Lebed	Alexander_Lebed	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed	431579
was
playing
for
a
united
team
and
that
the

took

rebel

If
that
were
the
case
,
it
was
unclear
why
Lebed	B	Lebed	Alexander_Lebed	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed	431579
suddenly
found
it
necessary
to
have
the

verified

Lebed	B	Lebed	Alexander_Lebed	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed	431579

was
concerned

powerful
interests

,
who
have
profited
from
the

and
want
it
to
go

would
seize
on
any
inadequacy
in
the

to
remove
him
.

warned
that
Lebed	B	Lebed	Alexander_Lebed	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed	431579

the
same
fate
as

former
Russian	B	Russian	Russia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia	25391

commander

who
sought

forces
.

Maskhadov	B	Maskhadov	Aslan_Maskhadov	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aslan_Maskhadov	340963
may
also
have
made
new
demands
on
Lebed	B	Lebed	Alexander_Lebed	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed	431579
,
forcing
him
to
check
back
with
the
Kremlin	B	Kremlin	Government_of_Russia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia	9787373
on
what
he
could
offer
.

said
the
two
military
men
had
come
close
to
agreement
on
a
face-saving
formula
acceptable
to
both
sides

involving
a

at
some
future
date
.

proposed
September

as
the
date
for
parliamentary
debate
on
an
opposition
no-confidence
motion
accusing
him
of
incompetence
.

The
president
of
parliament
had
earlier
said
September
11
could
be
set
for
the
debate
.

The
opposition
motion
against
Banharn	B	Banharn	--NME--
accuses
him
of
being
incompetent
,
lacking
ethical
leadership
and
alleges
his
administration
is
corrupt
.

His
critics
allege
he
may
be
attempting
to
delay
the
debate
.

Banharn	B	Banharn	--NME--
has
denied
the
accusations
and
said
he
is
ready
to
clear
himself
in
parliament
.

"
In
my
opinion
September
18
would
be
a
convenient
date
for
the
government
to
answer
questions
.

This
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
accusation
that
I
am
trying
to
escape
the
debate
,
"
Banharn	B	Banharn	--NME--
told

after
meeting

The

like
the

But
they
are
also
campaigning
on
broader
issue
such
as
stopping
the
government
road
building
programme
and
out-of-town
superstores

they
say
create
more
traffic
,
pollution

The

has
slashed

Although

have
contributed
to
the

it
has
been
seen
primarily
as
economic
rather
than
ecological

"
I
do

realise
the
impact

"
But
they
are
more
alert
than
they
were
3-4
years

.

There
's
no
doubt
it

a
big

"

He
says
the
damage
comes
in
two
forms
:
"
Tangible
--
in
the
form
of
extra
costs
,
additional
security
,
threats
to

and
the
more
intangible
damage
caused
by
negative
publicity
.
"

Watts	B	Watts	--NME--
said
the
cost
of
protesting
can
be
heavy
once
the
company
is
locked
into
a
contract
.

"
I
do
often
hear
on
the
industry
circuit
of
tales
where
the
company
tenders
at
low
margins
and
the
demonstrations
which
follow
means
they
are
running
the
project
at
a
loss

"

Harding	B	Harding	--NME--
says
others
have
done
the
same
.
"

As
a
result
of
eco-terrorism
we
are
looking

jobs
more
closely
to

if
the

margins
are
wide
enough

cover

"

For
an
industry
already
suffering
from
razor-thin
margins

overcapacity
and
stagnant
demand
,
eco-terrorism
is
the

bizarre
twist

But
there

no

Around

it

Chang	B	Chang	Michael_Chang	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chang	391834

conditions

of
the
erratic
play
in
his
match
with
Oncins	B	Oncins	Jaime_Oncins	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Oncins	3931197
,
who
had

.

Chang	B	Chang	Michael_Chang	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chang	391834
committed
an
untidy
53
unforced
errors
,
though
he
made
seven
fewer
than
the
Brazilian	B	Brazilian	Brazil	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil	3383
,
who
also
walloped
a
woeful
24
double
faults
.

The
most
deflating
double
fault
came
when
Oncins	B	Oncins	Jaime_Oncins	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Oncins	3931197
was
serving
to
force
a
fifth
set
,
leading
6-4
in
the
tiebreaker
.

The
set
point
came
after
confusion
at
the
net
on
the
point
previous
,
which
was
awarded
to
Oncins	B	Oncins	Jaime_Oncins	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Oncins	3931197
after
the
two
exchanged
shots
at
close
quarters
at
the
net
.

First
Chang	B	Chang	Michael_Chang	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chang	391834
approached
the
umpire
,
then
Oncins	B	Oncins	Jaime_Oncins	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Oncins	3931197
,
then
Chang	B	Chang	Michael_Chang	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chang	391834
again
before
play
finally
resumed
.

"
Those
little
seconds
were

an
hour
to
me
,
"
said
Oncins	B	Oncins	Jaime_Oncins	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Oncins	3931197
,
who
promptly
fired
two
serves
barely
contained
by
the
baseline
as
he
frittered
away
his
best
chance
.

Chang	B	Chang	Michael_Chang	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chang	391834
ran
off
the
next
three
points
to
close
out
the
match
but
for
Oncins	B	Oncins	Jaime_Oncins	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Oncins	3931197
,
the
contest
was
a
personal
victory
.

The
26-year-old
Brazilian	B	Brazilian	Brazil	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil	3383
had
risen
into
the
top
30
in
1992

The
next

He

,
who
subsequently
lost
interest
in

.

Hungary	B	Hungary	Hungary	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary	13275

the

Despite
the
current
difficulties
,
however
,
analysts
were
convinced
that

outlook
was
strong
.

"

"

Just
like
many
other
companies

,
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--
has
big
growth
opportunities
.
"

"
At
the
same
time
,
it
's
an
advantage
for

that
it
has
a
foreign
management
which
perhaps
understands
the
market
better
,
"
Erdei	B	Erdei	--NME--
added
.

"
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--
is
a
very
good
story
in
the
long-term
as
the
per
capita
packaging
consumption
is
still
so
low
in
east
Europe	B	Europe	Europe	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	9239
that
a
very
strong
increase
can
be
expected
(
long-term
)
,
"
Sitanyi	B	Sitanyi	--NME--
said
,
saying
that
several
recent
moves
by
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--
boosted
its
position
.

Among
them
,
he
noted
that
Cofinec	B	Cofinec	--NME--
had
acquired
the
outstanding
stake
in
its
Czech	B	Czech	Czech_Republic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic	5321
folding
company
Krpaco	B	Krpaco a.s.	--NME--
a.s.	I	Krpaco a.s.	--NME--
,
increasing
its
ownership
to
100
percent
,
so
in
the
second
half
the
whole
of
Krpaco	B	Krpaco	--NME--
's
figures
will
be
consolidated
.

The
company
also
repaid
some
$
21
million
of
debt
,
well
above
the
originally
planned
$
8
million
to
$
9
million
.

In
addition
,
its
Polish	B	Polish	Poland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland	22936
operation
began
with
some
six
weeks
of
delay
due
to
cold
winter
weather
and
the
test
run
was
also
longer
than
planned
.

smoothe
the
functioning
of
government
in
periods
of
crisis
.

But
Meri	B	Meri	Lennart_Meri	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Meri	379531
,
67
,
has
been
accused
in
parliament
of
taking
too
much
power
and
not
always
consulting
parliamentarians
before
making
decisions
.

His
relations
with
a
leftist-led
government
have
sometimes
been
tense
.

His
support
in
the
first
round
of
voting
on
Monday
was
much
lower
than
expected
,
scoring
only
45
votes
,
which
political
analysts
put
down
as
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
his
performance
.

This
support
only
inched
up
to
49
in
the
second
vote
.

Support
for
Ruutel	B	Ruutel	Arnold_R\u00fc\u00fctel	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Rüütel	341466
,
68
,
remained
constant
at
34
votes
.

If
the
third
vote
fails
to
give
either
Meri	B	Meri	Lennart_Meri	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Meri	379531
or
Ruutel	B	Ruutel	Arnold_R\u00fc\u00fctel	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Rüütel	341466
68
votes
,
the
parliamentary
speaker
will
convene
an
electoral
college
of
101
MPs
and
273
local
goverment
representatives
to
hold
a
new
poll
that
could
include
new
nominations
.

This
would
be
the
first
time
that
the
former
Soviet	B	Soviet	Soviet_Union	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union	26779
republic
has
had
to
call
together
an
electoral
college
.

In
its
first
presidential
election
in
1992
Meri	B	Meri	Lennart_Meri	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Meri	379531
won
the
necessary

in
in
a
parliamentary
election
against
Ruutel	B	Ruutel	Arnold_R\u00fc\u00fctel	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Rüütel	341466
.

Parliamentary
organisers
said
the
exact
timetable
remained
unclear
but
it
would
probably
take
about
a
month
to
organise
an
electoral
college
which
could
also
hold
several

of
voting
before
a
clear
winner
emerges

and	I	Securities and Exchange Commission	--NME--
Exchange	I	Securities and Exchange Commission	--NME--
Commission	I	Securities and Exchange Commission	--NME--
Wednesday
approved
rules
designed
to
give
stock
market
investors
a
better
chance
at
getting
the
best
price
available
for
their
orders
.

The
so-called
order
handling
rules
,
which
were
proposed
last
September
,
were
approved
in
a
4-0
vote
.

The
new
rules
will
require
specialists
at
stock
exchanges
and
market
makers
on
Nasdaq	B	Nasdaq	NASDAQ	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ	21559
to
allow
customers
to
view
price
quotes
from
other
electronic
trading
systems
that
may
not
be
readily
available
to
them
.

The
rules
will
also
require
that
customer
limit
orders
be
displayed
with
prices
better
than
those
available
in
quotes
publicly
available
at
the
time
.

Specialists
and
market
makers
are
companies
or
individuals
recognised
as
qualified
to
maintain
an
orderly
market
in
a
stock
.

In
a
limit
order
,
investors
specify
the
price
at
which
they
are
willing
to
buy
or
sell
,
as
opposed
to
a
market
order
executed
at
prevailing
prices
.

"
These
rules
are
intended
to
empower
all
investors
,
by
allowing
their
orders
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
,
and
by
providing
the
disclosure
they
need
to
make
informed
decisions
,
"
said
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--
Chairman
Arthur	B	Arthur Levitt	Arthur_Levitt	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Levitt	902148
Levitt	I	Arthur Levitt	Arthur_Levitt	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Levitt	902148
.

The
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--
's
goal
,
he
added
,
was
to
create
"
one
system
where
one
price
could
be
available
to
everybody
.
"

The
director
of
the
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--
's
division
of
market
regulation
,
Richard	B	Richard Lindsey	--NME--
Lindsey	I	Richard Lindsey	--NME--

Street	I	Wall Street	Wall_Street	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street	37274
firms
will
probably
need
to
spend
about
$
7
million
to
carry
out
the
improvements
called
for
by
the
new
rules
.

In
proposing
the
rules
last
year
,
the
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--
noted
that
while
technology
has
improved
,
commonplace
practices
still
existed
that
worked
against
investors
'
best
interests
.

It
noted
that
customers
whose
orders
were
not
displayed
lost
the
chance
of
getting
the
best
possible
price
available
in
the
market
.

It
also
cited
the
potential
problem
of
a
two-tiered
market
in
which
market
makers
quote
one
price
to
public
investors
while
quoting
better
prices
in
private
systems
,
thus
robbing
investors
without
access
to
"
hidden
"
quotes
the
benefit
of
the
best
available
prices
.

Earlier
this
month
,
the
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--
settled
charges
of
alleged
malpractices
on
Nasdaq	B	Nasdaq	NASDAQ	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ	21559

,
agreed
to
spend
$
100
million
over
five
years
to
upgrade
its
oversight
of
brokers
'
trading
practices
.

The
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--
dropped
a
third
proposal
that
would
have
allowed
investors
with
market
orders
to
trade
at
a
better
price
if
there
were
shifts
in
prices
before
their
orders
were
executed
.

The
agency
said
it
would
monitor
effects
of
the
two
new
rules
before
considering
the
"
price
improvement
"
proposal
again
.

The
agency
also
proposed
rule
changes
that
would
require
continuous
"
bid
"
and
"
ask
"
quotations
from
exchange
specialists
and
market
makers
who
trade
more
than
1
percent
of

during
any
quarter
on
Nasdaq	B	Nasdaq	NASDAQ	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ	21559
.

The
SEC	B	SEC	--NME--

rule
will
mean

with
a
decree
extending
the
current
legal
framework
for
television
stations
until
January
31
,
1997
.

The
decree
plugs
a
legal
void
in
which
magistrates
could
have
forced
the
former
prime
minister
to
take
one
of
the
three
stations
he
controls
off

because
of
a
court
ruling
that
no
single
proprietor
should
be
allowed
to
keep
three

"
One

,
hit
the

The

said
he
was
not
sure
whether
any
more
passengers
were
still
trapped
in
the
wreckage
.

Doctors
and
medical
staff
from
a
hospital
across

at
the

of
the
accident
within
minutes
and
were
able
to
treat
the
injured
quickly
,
he
added
.

Greater
damage
was
averted
as
the

SWP	B	SWP	--NME--
said
it
was
analyzing
potential
partnerships
with
hog
farmers
and
expected
the
first
deal
to
be
in
place
in
1997
.

The
end
of
Canada	B	Canada	Canada	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada	5042916
's
rail
freight
subsidy
last
year
caused
a
shift
in
feed
grain
production
to
the
eastern
Prairie
.

Analysts
said
livestock
production
would
likely
shift
to
the
eastern
Prairie
rather
than
feed
grains
being
shipped
to
the
western
Prairie
.

SWP	B	SWP	--NME--
said
it
may
develop
pork
production
systems
that
provide
farmers
with
large
integrated
units
,
and
it
may
consider
contracting
programs
between
producers
and

would

exchanged
his
reputation
as

clown
prince
of
tennis
on
Wednesday
for
a
new
no-nonsense
attitude
that
has
made
life
on
the
courts
fun
again
.

"
I
think
I
'm
much
more
focused
on
what
I
have
to
do
,
and
that
's
playing
tennis
,

Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Andriy_Medvedev	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Medvedev	702849

.

It
was
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Andriy_Medvedev	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Medvedev	702849
's
sixth
victory
in
a
row
after

"
I
realised

that
without
putting
99.9
percent
of
your
mind
into
tennis
,
I
do
n't
think
you
can
successful

"
said
the

.

"
The
whole
day
I
'm
thinking
abnout
tennis
.

I
felt
that
all
the
other
things
I
was
doing
the
years
before
,
they
were
distracting
me
,
they
were
not
helping
me
at
all
.
"

For
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Andriy_Medvedev	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Medvedev	702849
that
meant
confining
his
post-match
comments
to
tennis
and
not
going
off
on
tirades
about
about
peripheral
issues
such
as
the
poor
quality
of
food
in
the
players
lounge
,
an
entertaining
rant
that
took
his
mind
off
the
task
at
hand
.

"
I
know
what
I
'm
here
for
,
"
said
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Andriy_Medvedev	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Medvedev	702849
,
who
lost
in
the
second
round
of
the
Open	B	Open	--NME--
the
last
two
years
after
reaching
the
quarters
in
1993
,
the
same
year
he
tried
his
hand
as
a
restaurant
critic
.

"
I
'm
not
here
to
fight
the
press
or
talk
about
the
food
or
entertain
the
people
off
the
court
.

I
'm
here
to
play
tennis
and
to
win
.

I
have
much
less
fun
off
the
court
.

I
have
much
more
fun
on
the
court
,
"
he
said
.

Just
three
years
ago
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Andriy_Medvedev	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Medvedev	702849
was
one
of
the

and
winning
three
tournaments
.

But
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Andriy_Medvedev	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Medvedev	702849
's
ranking
slowly
began
to
drop
last
year
as
he
struggled
with
a
wrist
injury
.

The
Ukrainian	B	Ukrainian	Ukraine	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine	31750
finally
hit
a
low
of
44th
two
months

of
his
current
ranking
of
36
.
"

It
's
a
part
of
the
penalty
that
I
have
to
accept

's
77-minute

past
Fleurian	B	Fleurian	Jean\u002dPhilippe_Fleurian	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Fleurian	4026812
was
rather
ordinary
,
the
fact
that
the
two
were
playing
each
other
was
rather
remarkable
.

In

original
draw
,
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Andriy_Medvedev	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Medvedev	702849
and
Fleurian	B	Fleurian	Jean\u002dPhilippe_Fleurian	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Fleurian	4026812
were
slotted
to
play

other
.

forced
the
draw
to
be
done
over
--
against
odds
of
151-to-1
--
Medvedev	B	Medvedev	Andriy_Medvedev	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Medvedev	702849

drew
each

a

time

draw

did

change
my
preparation

in
compiling
his
party
's
report
.

Since
it
began
work
in
April
the
commission
has
been
hearing
harrowing
tales
from
the
victims
of
apartheid-era
abuses
,
by
both
the
white
minority
regime
and
its
opponents
.

It
also
wants
to
hear
from
those
who
committed
the
abuses
,
to
whom
it
can
offer
amnesty
in
return
for
frankness
.

Hopes
that
reformed
perpetrators
would
come
forward
voluntarily
have
faded
but
the
commission
has
the
legal
power
to
force
them
to
appear
.

Allen	B	Allen	--NME--
declined
to
give
say
who
would
be
subpoenaed
.

"
At
the

we
have
a
preliminary

people

The

1996-08-28

The
British	B	British	United_Kingdom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	31717
government
on
Wednesday
lowered
the
noise
limits
for
London	B	London	London	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	17867
's
Heathrow	B	Heathrow	Heathrow\u002c_London	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow,_London	94089
,
Gatwick	B	Gatwick	Gatwick_Airport	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatwick_Airport	101359
and
Stansted	B	Stansted	London_Stansted_Airport	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport	65456
airports
and
announced
it
would
make
a
bigger
effort
in
detecting
and
fining
violators
.

The
limits
,
effective
from
January
1
,
1997
,
are
reduced
as
much
as
possible
while
still
complying
with
international
obligations
,
a
spokesman
for
the
Department	B	Department of Transport	--NME--
of	I	Department of Transport	--NME--
Transport	I	Department of Transport	--NME--
said
.

The
maximum
noise
level
during
the
day
is
trimmed
by
three
decibels
to
94
,
while
the
night
time
level
is
reduced
by
two
decibels
to
87
.

"
It
is
a
smaller
reduction
in
terms
of
loudness
than
was
sought
by
local
people
.

Nevertheless
I
am
satisfied
that
the
overall
benefits
will
be
worthwile
,
"
Lord
Goschen	B	Goschen	--NME--
,
minister
for
aviation
,
said
in
a
statement
.

The
ministry
said
it
believed
the
new
limits
could
be
met
with
existing
aircraft
.
"

They
can
be
flown
in
quieter
ways
,
"
a
spokesman
said
.

The
reduction
in
noise
levels
is
the
same
as
proposed
in
a
consultation
paper
which
was
published
in
October
1995
.

The
present
noise
levels
have
applied
at
Heathrow	B	Heathrow	Heathrow\u002c_London	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow,_London	94089
,
one
of
the
world
's
busiest
airports
,
since
1959
and
at
Gatwick	B	Gatwick	Gatwick_Airport	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatwick_Airport	101359
since
1968
.

The
number
of
monitors
will
be
increased
and
some
will
be
repositioned
to
detect
noisy
planes
.

she
was

it

Wednesday
as
the
1996
edition
of
the
world
's
biggest
tomato
fight
began
in

Spanish	B	Spanish	Spain	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain	26667
village
of
Bunol	B	Bunol	Bu\u00f1ol	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buñol	277229
.

Thousands
of
people
pelted
each
other
with
armfuls
of
ripe
tomatoes
as
streets
,
walls
and
windows
were
coated
in
a
blood-red
wash
.

A
single
firework
after
midday
signalled
the
start
of
the
fruit-throwing
frenzy
,
during
which
participants
hurl
some
100
tonnes
of
tomatoes
trucked
in
for
the
occasion
.

Local
historians
say
the
tradition
began
in
1945
when
disgruntled
locals
began
spontaneously
to
bombard
the
priest
and
mayor
at
the
annual
fiesta
in
Bunol	B	Bunol	Bu\u00f1ol	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buñol	277229
(
pronounced
Boo-nee-OL	B	Boo-nee-OL	--NME--
)
.

The
festival
's
fame
has
grown
and
now
attracts
between
15,000
and
20,000
people
,
many
of
them
foreigners
.

However

"
Our

were

initially

they
sold
off
on

,
"
a
dealer
said
.

Volumes
were
reasonable
in
the
money
market
but
thin
in
bonds
.

Dealers
said
the
market
seemed
to
be
trading
a
range
and
would
wait
for
more
political
polls
to
provide
direction
.

They
were
confident
of

but
said
the
timing
was
less

Commission	I	European Commission	European_Commission	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	9974

's

cow
epidemic
would
die
out

but
offered
little
prospect
the
findings
would
change
an
agreed
slaughter
campaign
.

"
Obviously
we
are
interested
in
this
research
.

We
will
ask
the
(
EU	B	EU	--NME--
)
scientific
and
veterinary
committee
to
examine
it
,
"

Gerard	B	Gerard Kiely	--NME--
Kiely	I	Gerard Kiely	--NME--
told
Reuters	B	Reuters	Reuters	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters	18998750
.

But
he
added
that
new
research
into
the
dynamics
of
the
bovine
spongiform
encephalopathy
(
BSE	B	BSE	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	19344418
)
,
a
fatal
brain-wasting
disease
suffered
by
cattle
,
was
unlikely
to
alter
a
slaughter
plan
agreed
by
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	31717
and
its
14
EU	B	EU	--NME--
partners
.

"
We
agreed
that
following
detailed
scientific
analysis
using
a
methodology
which
would
take
out
the
maximum
number
of
BSE	B	BSE	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	19344418
cases
possible
.

I
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
sell
to
the
European	B	European Commission	European_Commission	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	9974
Commission	I	European Commission	European_Commission	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	9974
a

which
would
involve
the
elimination
of
fewer
BSE	B	BSE	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	19344418
cases
,
"
Kiely	B	Kiely	--NME--
said
.

"
We
will
look
at
our
approach
(
to
the
plan
)
but
we
wo
n't
get
involved
with
the
number
of
animals
to
be
slaughtered
,
"
he
said
.

"
We
have
always
avoided
the
question
of
numbers
of
animals
to
be
slaughtered
,
that
's
not
the
issue
.

The
issue
is
the
protection
of
consumers
'
health
and
the
rapid
eradication
of
BSE	B	BSE	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	19344418
,
"
he
added
.

The
reaction
is
likely
to
disappoint
British	B	British	United_Kingdom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	31717
farmers
,
who
seized
on
research
by
Oxford	B	Oxford	University_of_Oxford	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford	31797
scientists
in
the
scientific
journal
Nature	B	Nature	Nature_\u0028journal\u0029	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)	43427
saying
it
would
be
hard
to
get
rid
of
the
disease
any
faster
than
2001
without
killing
vast
numbers
of
cattle
.

The
researchers
predicted
there
would
be
340
new
infections
and
14,000
new
cases
of
BSE	B	BSE	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy	19344418

called
on
Wednesday
for
an
urgent
meeting
with

to
discuss
the
report
.

"
I
hope
the

will
now
make
it
clear
they
believe
there
is
a
better
way
of
dealing
with
this
issue

Naish	B	Naish	--NME--
said
there
was
no
need
for
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	31717
to
carry
out
a
planned
cull
of

to
which
it
had
reluctantly
agreed
to
placate
its
European	B	European	European_Union	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union	9317
partners
.

"
The
new
evidence
to
me
means
some
of
that
proposal
should
be
re-examined
because
we
could
get
away
with
considerably
less
animals
being
culled
if
in
fact
scientists
throughout
Europe	B	Europe	Europe	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	9239
accepted
this
evidence
,
"
Naish	B	Naish	--NME--
said
.

The
report
could
well
reopen
a
damaging
row
between
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	31717
and
the
EU	B	EU	--NME--
,
which

during

he
revelled
in

Pennsylvania	I	University of Pennsylvania	University_of_Pennsylvania	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania	31793
Medical
Centre
said
in
a
release
.

Muscular
dystrophy
is
a
fatal
illness
in
which
the
body
's
muscle
tissue
degenerates
and
is
replaced
by
fat
.

Death
strikes
in
early
adulthood
.

Individuals
with
the
disease
have
a
non-working
version
of
a
gene
responsible
for
producing
a
crucial
muscle
protein
called
dystrophin
.

In
the
study
at
the
University
's
Institute	B	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--
for	I	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--
Human	I	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--
Gene	I	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--
Therapy	I	Institute for Human Gene Therapy	--NME--
,
researchers
altered
a
common-cold
virus
to
carry
a
version
of
the
working
dystrophin
gene
.

The
virus
,
which
also
was
altered
to
minimise
its
susceptibility
to
the
immune
system
,
was
then
injected
into
the
muscle
cells
of
mice
bred
to
lack
dystrophin
genes
.

In
the
experiment
,
between
30
to
40
percent
of
the
muscle
fibers
in
one
group
of
mice
produced
dystrophin
for
two
weeks
before
diminishing
.

Similar
results
had
been
obtained
previously
in
test-tube
cell
cultures
,
but
not
in
live
animals
,
the
university
said
.

The
university
said
methods
are
still
needed
to
make
enough
of
the
altered
virus
to
treat
humans
,
to
further
decrease
the
immune-system
response
to
the
virus
,
and
to
deliver
the
virus
to
human
muscle
tissue
.

he
was
hopeful
new

to
support
him
would
be
available
for
a
civil
trial
next
month
.

The
former

was
found
not
guilty
by
a
criminal
trial
jury
last
October
of
the
murders
of
his

Goldman	I	Ronald Goldman	Ronald_Goldman	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Goldman	430438
,
in
June
1994
.

He
now
faces
a
civil
suit
brought
by
families
of
the
victims
who
hold
him
responsible
for
the
deaths
.

He
told
reporters
a
court
order
not
to
talk
about
his
case
kept
him
from
detailing
how
he
has
fulfilled
his
pledge
to
find
the
killers
.

But
he
added
without
elaborating
,
"
hopefully
we
will
see
some
things
come
out
in
this
next
trial
.
"

The
judge
in
the
civil
trial
has
imposed
a
sweeping
gag
order
that
prohibits
lawyers
,
witnesses
and
parties
to
the
case
from
discussing
it
with
the
media
or
elsewhere
in
public
.

"
I

"
said
Simpson	B	Simpson	O\u002e_J\u002e_Simpson	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson	8955445
,
who
vowed
after
his
acquittal
to
find
the
killers
and
offered
a
substantial
reward
.

His
lawyers
have
said
his
defence
in
the
civil
trial
that
starts
Sept
.

17
will
be
that
he
did
not
kill
the
victims
.

Simpson	B	Simpson	O\u002e_J\u002e_Simpson	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson	8955445
said
at
the
hotel
news
conference
his
plans
include
eventually
writing
another
book
.

He
added
that
he
has
had
job
offers
but
more
have
come
from
abroad
than
at
home
.

"
I
'm
broke
.

I
am
not
crying

blues
.

I
can
get
along
just
fine
,
"
he
said
.
"

Whatever
you
want
to
send
me
,
I
need
.
"

He
again
accused
the
news
media
of
erroneous
reporting
on
his
case
but
did
not
signal
any
plans
for
lawsuits
as
he
did
on

in
an

at

,
Simpson	B	Simpson	O\u002e_J\u002e_Simpson	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson	8955445
said
,
he
has
received
support
from
both
blacks
and
whites
.

He
again
dismissed
charges
that
he
had
distanced
himself
from
the
black
community
during
his
successful
football
and
commercial
career
,
only
to
seek
their

after

that
it
planned
to
pull
out
of
the
highly
competitive
modem-chip
business
and
focus
instead
on
the
fast-growing
market
for
computer
networking
equipment
.

"
Certainly
the
company
will
be
a
much
smaller
company
now
,
but
it
will
be

But

still

it
,
including
cutting
as
many
as
150
jobs
from

,
which
currently
has

people
,
and
building
up

of
its
PMC-Sierra	B	PMC-Sierra	--NME--
unit
,
which
makes
routing
devices
and
chipsets
for
high-speed
computer
networks
.

The
company
has
announced
plans
to
take
a
charge
against
earnings
of
$
50
million
to
$

to
write

the

likely
would

difficulty
selling

.

"
Once
you
announce
your
intention
to
exit
a
business
,
it
becomes
a
complete

,
"
he
said
.

And
he
said
that
while
the

is
focusing
on
the
fastest-growing
part
of
its
business
,
the
market
for
networking
chips
has
begun
to
attract
the

players

as
International	B	International Business Machines Corp	--NME--
Business	I	International Business Machines Corp	--NME--
Machines	I	International Business Machines Corp	--NME--
Corp	I	International Business Machines Corp	--NME--
.

"
As
the
market
develops
the
question
is
,
are
they
able
to
make
that
transition
to
be
a
much
larger
company
?
"

Randall	B	Randall	--NME--
said
.

Other
analysts
were
more
bullish
,
even
though
the
company
is
expected
to
shrink
to
slightly
more
than
half
its

despite
the
fact
that
some
kerosene
was
in
storage
at
Dubai	B	Dubai	Dubai	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai	211583

a

on
Thursday
,
up
from

last

.

Dealers
expected

to
stick
around
current
levels
for
the
next
two
or
three

,
before
they
get
a
boost
in

the

I
'm
still
suspicious
that
they
will
buy
more
in

,
"
another
said

But
traders
see
the
market
remaining
tight
in
the
short-term
,
with
some
surplus
arising
closer
to
October
.

"
I
see
an
overhang
of
gas
oil
further
out
,
"
one
said
.

"
Gas
oil
will
remain
tight
in
the
short
term
up
to
mid-September
with
the
premium
of
around
$
1
for
0.5
percent
(
sulphur

)
.

In
the
second
half
of
September
and
October
we
see
the
premium
coming
off
to
70-75
cents
.
"

Traders
said
there
was
not
much
demand
for
one
percent
sulphur

,
with
the
premium
at
40
to
45

oportunity

seeing
you

full
enjoyment
of
freedom

I
would
like
to
no

sic
)
if
you
are
still
in
slavery
if
you
are
,
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
shall
have
crushed
the
system
that
now
oppreses
you
for
in
the
course
of
three
months
you
shall
have
your
liberty
.

Great
is
the
outpouring
of
the
coloured
people
that
is
now
rallying
with
the
heart
of
lions
against
the
very
curse
that
has
separated
you
and
me

Compared

the

of

predicted
a
sluggish
first
half
and
a
rebound
later
in

,
Hope	B	Hope	--NME--
said
:
"
I

the

now

is
the

not

bad
as
some
felt
it
was
going
to
be
,
but
equally
we
're
certainly
not
predicting
a
recovery
in

"

Against
this
background
,
Hope	B	Hope	--NME--
said
the

was
glad
it

the
