Best Buy Announces 'Blue Label'  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook" cat="">Notebook</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer" cat="invention	computer	class	person">PCs</a>  10.07.08 by has launched two new notebooks under its own, branded " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueLabel" cat="">Blue Label</a> ". The two new notebooks, from and , are being offered alongside other branded notebooks from other manufacturers, such as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell" cat="brand	company	manufacturer	contractor	vendor">Dell</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc." cat="company">Gateway</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  may also expand the " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueLabel" cat="">Blue Label</a> " program into areas beyond  <b>laptops</b>, although a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  executive said he was not prepared to talk about future plans.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  will introduce two new notebooks: the HP dv3510nr and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba" cat="company	manufacturer	brand">Toshiba</a>  e105-s140, according to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason" cat="">Jason</a>  Bonfig,  <b>vice president</b> of the  <b>computing</b> division at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a> . Both will be priced identically at $1,199 as standard  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock-keeping_unit" cat="terms	identifier">SKUs</a> , he said. The HP and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba" cat="company	manufacturer	brand">Toshiba</a>   <b>laptops</b> went on sale this week. For years,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  has offered notebooks designed by major  <b>notebook</b> manufacturers like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard_Company" cat="">Hewlett-Packard</a> , and sold exclusively through  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a> ; the  <b>retailer</b> also has a  <b>house brand</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insignia" cat="">Insignia</a> , for  <b>televisions</b>. Today, almost 30 to 40 percent of the notebooks sold at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  are designed for the  <b>retailer</b> alone, Bonfig said. "What's different with this platform is that it has been completely developed from the ground up to meet customer needs," Bonfig said. Bonfig said that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  had actually been involved with the design process, interjecting itself into a phase that usually is negotiated between the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer" cat="license	terms">OEM</a>  and a  <b>contract manufacturer</b>, which actually produces the product. The  <b>retailer</b> has gathered a "tremendous amount of feedback" from consumers, either directly or via the "blue shirt" network of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  employees. Moreover,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  also seems open to  <b>suggestions</b>; when told that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Magazine" cat="magazine	medium	periodical">PC Magazine</a>  readers would probably prefer a system restore disc rather than restore options via a  <b>system partition</b>, Bonfig promised to "make a note" for future review. (Both of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a> 's new notebooks use a system restore  <b>partition</b>, however.) In the case of the HP  <b>notebook</b>, for example, adding an additional 9- or 12-cell battery usually means an unsightly barrel or stand that houses the additional  <b>battery</b>. With the new HP dv3510nr, however, the additional  <b>battery</b> will sit flush against the  <b>chassis</b>. Customers also asked for and received notebooks that were less than 5  <b>pounds</b>, less than 1.5 inches thick, with a  <b>backlit</b>  <b>keyboard</b>, and a standard two-year  <b>warranty</b>. Customers who purchase either notebook also have a 30-day period of free  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Squad" cat="company">Geek Squad</a>  Q&A assistance, Bonfig said. But the  <b>notebook</b> does not come with free  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Squad" cat="company">Geek Squad</a>   <b>tech support</b>  <b></b> for example, a customer who wanted to know how to move files from an old  <b>laptop</b> to the new purchase would be pointed to  <b>file-transfer</b>  <b>wizards</b> within  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista" cat="">Vista</a> ; if a customer  <b>wished</b> to have  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Squad" cat="company">Geek Squad</a>  actually handle the transfer, the customer will pay a  <b>service charge</b>, he said.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>   <b>salespeople</b> are not  <b>commissioned</b>, "and that's not changing anytime soon," Bonfig said.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueLabel" cat="">Blue Label</a>  notebooks will not be given preference over other brands, he said, and will  <b>simply</b> be offered as another solution. The HP Pavilion dv3510nr is priced at $1,199, and includes a  <b>backlit</b>  <b>keyboard</b>, weighs 4.6  <b>pounds</b>, and is less than  <b>1.41</b> inches thin. It includes a 13.3-inch  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_XGA" cat="">WXGA</a>  LED-lit  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossy_display" cat="">BrightView</a>   <b>widescreen</b> display. The  <b>notebook</b> can operate up to four hours on a single charge. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba_Satellite" cat="brand">Toshiba Satellite</a>  E105-S1402 is also priced at $1,199, with a keyboard "that is visible in low light". The  <b>notebook</b> weighs 4.99  <b>pounds</b>, is 1.2 inches thin, and includes a 14.1-inch diagonal  <b>widescreen</b>. However, the  <b>notebook</b> can run 5.5 hours on a single charge. The " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueLabel" cat="">Blue Label</a> " models may also help  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a> 's  <b>brand</b>  <b>cachet</b>, which has fared far better than its rival, Circuit City. Circuit City saw  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  sales drop  <b>10.6</b> percent to $2.24 billion, compared to the same period last year, which the company attributed to a worsened  <b>macroeconomic</b> environment, competitive pressures and a weakened  <b>brand</b> position.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a> , meanwhile, reported a 12 percent increase in revenue to $9.8 billion, including a 4.2 percent comparable store sales gain versus a year ago.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income" cat="principle">Net income</a>  dipped slightly but was nevertheless profitable, at $202 million. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueLabel" cat="">Blue Label</a>  may be extended to other categories,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  said. "[ <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueLabel" cat="">Blue Label</a> ] shows  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a>  is listening to its customers," Bonfig said. "It's going to bring more customers to us, more often, more  <b>frequently</b>, and it will bring growth to the category."  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor's_Note" cat="racehorse	person	winner">Editor's Note</a> : The story has been updated to note that both notebooks have begun selling, according to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy" cat="company	retailer">Best Buy</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Add" cat="">Add</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" cat="format	standard	introduction">RSS</a>  feed to your  <b>feed reader</b> so that you don't miss another headline! newsletters Get  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Magazine" cat="magazine	medium	periodical">PCMag.com</a> 's FREE  <b>email</b> newsletters delivered to your  <b>inbox</b>.
