John Lenz/Daily Star St.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" cat="writer	doctor	philosopher	commentator	theologian	person	saint	catholic	mystic	member	apologist">Thomas Aquinas</a>  head coach John White blanches when he hears someone use the ‘L' word around a fine  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school" cat="school	type">Catholic school</a>  like STA. “Hey, let's get rid of this ‘loaded' thing; let's just talk about experience,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  said with a laugh. “We <b>'ve</b> got experience. They <b>'ve</b> still got to work, they <b>'ve</b> still got to perform. ‘Loaded” is not a good word, because if we're unsuccessful, I'm unemployed.” OK,  <b>coach</b>. We'll ignore the District 9-2A championship you won last year, the 19 starters you have coming back, the roster that's load... er, stocked, with more numbers and depth than Falcons fans have seen in a long while. We'll ignore it because being the favorite doesn't always count for much - like last year, when Springfield was -  <b>ahem</b> - loaded but ended up finishing second to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" cat="club	sport	team">Falcons</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  will concede that STA's got a big  <b>tool box</b> this year. But he also knows from first-hand experience that there are  <b>intangibles</b> that come into play in this situation. Maybe the biggest is, sure the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" cat="club	sport	team">Falcons</a>  have a boatload of seniors, but will they lead, and in which direction. ADVERTISEMENT “I remember in  <b>1997</b> (at Riverside), we were ranked No. 1 in the  <b>state</b> before the season,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  said. “Didn't have any senior leadership, all individuals. Kids couldn't get along, didn't  <b>want to</b> work. We went 5-5. “In '98, we had a good senior class but less talent - we went 14-1 and we went to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome" cat="elements	invention	feature	dome">Dome</a> . So if we have good senior leadership, we can reach our potential.” Safe to say last year's team reached its potential. The  <b>springboard</b> was a victory in week two over  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America" cat="">Episcopal</a> , which had gone 8-2 and had beaten STA like a  <b>drum</b> for a couple of years. But the Falcons won that one 31-13 - “I felt like we won the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl" cat="playoff	event">Super Bowl</a> ,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  said - and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" cat="club	sport	team">Falcons</a>  got a little  <b>mojo</b>. But the  <b>punctuation mark</b> was the district opener, when the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" cat="club	sport	team">Falcons</a>  played without top  <b>running back</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Reed" cat="receiver	person	player">Josh Reed</a>  - but showed that their air game behind  <b>quarterback</b> Raymone Andrews was ready to flower. “We got that big upset against Springfield and that just launched us,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  said of the 21-20 victory. “Our passing game came alive. We saw it in spurts against Loranger, but we had a lot of dropped balls. A  <b>big catch</b> here or there against Loranger, we might win that game. “Then the day of the Springfield game we found out we wouldn't have  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Reed" cat="receiver	person	player">Josh Reed</a> . We were planning throw the ball anyway, because we had confidence. Six of our first seven snaps were passes. And it was like a  <b>springboard</b>. After that we became more than one dimensional.” When the  <b>smoke</b> cleared, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" cat="club	sport	team">Falcons</a>  had rolled through the league undefeated, but bruised and battered. The result was a 34-0 payback drubbing at the hands of Springfield. “We were banged up, especially defensively,” White said. “If we <b>'d</b> have had everybody healthy, it might have been a better game. But this year we return all those starters and their backups as well. So when we go  <b>second unit</b>, we're not dropping off a whole lot as far as knowledge. Maybe talent-wise, yes.” What last year did was  <b>buoy</b> the Falcons' confidence, which was also inflated by the  <b>state</b> championship runs of the  <b>basketball</b> and  <b>soccer</b> teams. The carryover shows up in the  <b>locker room</b>, where there are 71  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" cat="club	sport	team">Falcons</a>  stepping on each others' toes - a  <b>far cry</b> from the 26 players  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  had out for spring when he took the job two years ago. “The locker room is packed in like  <b>sardines</b> right now,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  said. “Two springs ago, we had 26 guys out there. Now it's  <b>looking</b> good.” So are the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" cat="club	sport	team">Falcons</a> . Still, they pay  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  to worry, and he's good at it. “You look at last year's team, we got better every week,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  said. “We <b>'ve</b> got to be able to look at this team and be able to say the same thing - not wins and losses, but did we get better every week? “I worry about us not reaching our potential,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">White</a>  said. “What is our potential? I don't know. We'll know that at the end of the year when we look back.” Comment  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog" cat="genre	politics">Blog</a>  - Note: All Comments Subject To Approval Comments are limited to 200 words or less.
