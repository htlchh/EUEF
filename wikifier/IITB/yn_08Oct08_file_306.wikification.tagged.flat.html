Newswise  <b>—</b> The  <b>herbal medicine</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  appears to work just as well as some prescribed  <b>antidepressants</b> for treating patients with  <b>major depression</b>, a new review finds. However, patients in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-speaking_Europe" cat="">German-speaking countries</a>  might experience the best benefits. While there is  <b>public interest</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a>  about whether  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  adequately treats  <b>depression</b>, in some countries, like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" cat="state	republic	country	member	nation">Germany</a> , doctors commonly prescribe it for mild symptoms. Authors of the review found that studies with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" cat="state	republic	country	member	nation">German</a>  patients did, in fact, have the best results. The most striking  <b>finding</b> from our review is that trials from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-speaking_Europe" cat="">German-speaking countries</a>  have clearly more positive effects, both compared to  <b>placebo</b> and standard  <b>antidepressants</b>, than trials from elsewhere, said lead reviewer  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Baudelaire" cat="character	outlaw	orphan">Klaus</a>  Linde of the Centre for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine" cat="">Complementary Medicine</a>  Research at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_Munich" cat="institution	university">Technical University in Munich</a> . In principle, we can say that  <b>hypericum</b> extracts work in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-speaking_Europe" cat="">German-speaking countries</a> , but we are less certain for other countries. The review appears in the current issue of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Library" cat="">The Cochrane Library</a>  , a publication of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration" cat="">The Cochrane Collaboration</a> , an  <b>international organization</b> that evaluates research in all aspects of  <b>health care</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review" cat="">Systematic reviews</a>  draw  <b>evidence-based</b> conclusions about medical practice after considering both the content and quality of existing trials on a topic. A person could be experiencing  <b>major depression</b> when  <b>depression symptoms</b> interfere with his or her ability to work, sleep, eat and take pleasure in activities previously enjoyed. The symptoms usually last for at least two weeks, but can often last longer than several months.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  (an extract of the  <b>plant</b> Hypericum perforatum L.) is an  <b>herbal</b> alternative for patients who do not want prescribed  <b>antidepressants</b>. Exactly how the  <b>herb</b> works to treat  <b>depression</b> is unclear, partly because the extracts can contain at least seven groups of components, according to the reviewers. There is also no  <b>regulation</b> on what the extract must contain. There is no  <b>patent</b> protection on herbs; therefore, more or less anyone can market  <b>hypericum</b> extracts, Linde said. The  <b>products</b> on the market vary enormously in their quality and content in active ingredients. Linde added that consumers should be aware that many St. John's  <b>wort</b>  <b>products</b> on the market have very low concentrations (such as dosages of less than 300  <b>milligrams</b> per day), and therefore, probably act only by  <b>placebo</b> effects. In the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine" cat="establishment	organisation	institute">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine" cat="establishment	organisation	institute">NCCAM</a> ), a division of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health" cat="establishment	institute	agency">National Institutes of Health</a> , reports that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  is of minimal benefit in treating  <b>major depression</b>. A study co-funded by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine" cat="establishment	organisation	institute">NCCAM</a> , found  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  to be no more effective than  <b>placebo</b> in treating  <b>major depression</b> of moderate severity. Linde and his colleagues wrote a previous  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration" cat="">Cochrane review</a>  in  <b>2005</b> on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St Johns wort</a>  and concluded that it did reduce symptoms of mild to moderate  <b>depression</b>. The significant difference between the  <b>2005</b> review and the current one is the reviewers now include only studies restricted to  <b>major depression</b>, while the older version included all  <b>depressive disorders</b>. Compared to  <b>2005</b>, the evidence that  <b>hypericum</b> extracts are effective is better now, said Linde. The new version also for the first time shows significantly fewer  <b>side effects</b> associated with  <b>hypericum</b> extracts compared to  <b>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</b>. The current review evaluated 29 studies from a variety of countrieswith 5,489 patientsand all trials were randomized and  <b>double blind</b>. The reviewers compared treatment of patients with  <b>major depression</b> with extracts of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  for four to 12 weeks with either placebo or tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants and  <b>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</b>. According to the reviewers, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>   <b>products</b> tested in the trials were high- quality products and the daily extract dosages were between 500 and 1,200  <b>milligrams</b>. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration" cat="">Cochrane</a>  reviewers concluded the available evidence suggests that  <b>hypericum</b> extracts are superior to  <b>placebo</b> in treating patients with major  <b>depressions</b> and are similarly effective as standard  <b>antidepressants</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" cat="composer	person	winner	arranger	member	personnel">John Williams</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine" cat="title	degree">M.D.</a> ,  <b>director</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University" cat="university	institution">Duke</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_practice" cat="practice">Evidence-based Practice</a>  Center at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University" cat="university	institution">Duke University</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina" cat="city	seats	town	place">Durham</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Health_Administration" cat="">VA Medical Center</a> , has also done research on the use of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  for  <b>depression</b> and disagreed that patients with  <b>major depression</b> should turn to the product. Given the inconsistent evidence about  <b>efficacy</b> in  <b>major depression</b> and the  <b>questionable</b> quality of  <b>over-the-counter products</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  should not be a first or  <b>second choice</b> for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  patients with moderate to severe  <b>major depression</b>, he said. Williams added, however, that for patients with minor  <b>depression</b>, where the evidence for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_wort" cat="plant	inhibitor	species	antidepressant">St. Johns wort</a>  is more robust, it might be an option for patients who can find quality  <b>products</b>.
