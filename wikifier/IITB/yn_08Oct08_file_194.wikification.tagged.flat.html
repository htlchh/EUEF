It's a match made in snacking heaven: the pairing of  <b>pretzels</b> and  <b>chocolate</b>. Even better, there are scores of potential partnerships that bring out the best of both foods, depending on the type of  <b>chocolate</b> and  <b>pretzel</b> and any embellishments.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel" cat="bakery	food	loanword">Pretzel</a>  and  <b>chocolate</b> fans of all ages can satisfy their hankering by picking up a  <b>snack</b> at their local  <b>supermarket</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel" cat="bakery	food	loanword">Pretzel</a>  Dips from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snyder's_of_Hanover" cat="company	food">Snyder's of Hanover</a> , for example, are available in  <b>milk chocolate</b>,  <b>white chocolate</b>,  <b>special dark</b>  <b>chocolate</b> and  <b>chocolate</b>  <b>peanut butter</b> and have quickly become a hot product line. For those who  <b>want to</b> try their hand at home, chocolate and pretzel snacks are also easy to make. Indeed, the biggest challenge is deciding what match-up to try first. * Sticking with Tradition: Visit any  <b>candy store</b> or  <b>bake sale</b> and you're likely to see perennially popular chocolate-dipped  <b>pretzel</b> rods. They are simple to create. First, slowly melt the contents of one bag of  <b>chocolate chips</b> or melting discs (milk, dark or  <b>white chocolate</b> all work well) in a  <b>double boiler</b> or in a microwave-safe bowl. Be careful when handing  <b>hot chocolate</b> around youngsters. Next, using small  <b>tongs</b> or holding on to the edge on the side, lower the bottom 2/3 of the  <b>pretzel</b> rod into the melted  <b>chocolate</b> and twist the rod until it's coated with the  <b>chocolate</b>. Finally, lay the rod on  <b>wax paper</b> and let the  <b>chocolate</b> set. Optional: After the  <b>chocolate</b> sets slightly but does not harden, roll the rod in the topping of your choice, like  <b>sprinkles</b>, miniature  <b>candies</b>, colored  <b>sugar</b>, mini-marshmallows cut in half or chopped peanuts. * Decadent Double Dipping: For an even more indulgent treat, twirl pretzel rods in  <b>peanut butter</b> first, then dip or roll in melted  <b>chocolate</b>. Or dip  <b>pretzels</b> in warm  <b>caramel</b>, roll in chopped  <b>nuts</b> and dip in melted  <b>chocolate</b>. Finish with a  <b>drizzle</b> of melted  <b>white chocolate.</b> *  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_(album)" cat="album">Bark</a>  Better Than Bite: Mix instead of dip. Put pretzels (minis and homestyle work well) in a zippered  <b>plastic bag</b>. Break the  <b>pretzels</b> using the  <b>palm</b> of your hand or a  <b>wooden spoon</b> and set aside. Melt  <b>chocolate chips</b> (again, any variety/flavor) using a microwave or  <b>double boiler</b> and stir until smooth.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Add" cat="">Add</a>   <b>pretzel</b> pieces to the pot or bowl and mix well.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pour" cat="">Pour</a>  the mixture into a  <b>jelly roll</b> pan and spread with a  <b>metal</b>  <b>spatula</b> or the back of a  <b>spoon</b> until even. Place in the  <b>refrigerator</b> to harden for at least a  <b>half hour</b>. When ready to eat or serve, remove the  <b>bark</b> from the  <b>fridge</b> and break the  <b>bark</b> into pieces (irregular or jagged sizes are fine).  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigeration" cat="thermodynamics">Refrigerate</a>  again in an airtight  <b>container</b>. Optional: Add chopped  <b>nuts</b> or  <b>candies</b> for extra variety. * Seasons Eatings: For the holidays,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snyder's_of_Hanover" cat="company	food">Snyder's of Hanover</a>  has developed a special  <b>pretzel</b> wreath  <b>recipe</b> that's perfect for serving or bringing as a gift. Slowly melt  <b>chocolate chips</b> over low  <b>heat</b> in a small  <b>saucepan</b> or in a microwave-safe bowl and stir until smooth. Line a  <b>cookie sheet</b> with  <b>waxed paper</b> and place five mini-pretzels in a circle shape, with the bottom of the  <b>pretzels</b> -- the end that has one hole -- on the outside of the ring. Take one  <b>pretzel</b> at a time from the circle and dip the side halfway into the melted  <b>chocolate</b>. Then place it back into the circle. Form a second layer by dipping five additional  <b>pretzels</b>, one by one, in the  <b>chocolate</b>. Place them over the newly formed wreath, so that coated holes overlap two bottom  <b>pretzels</b>. Decorate with desired toppings, while the coating is still soft.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigeration" cat="thermodynamics">Refrigerate</a>  until coating is firm, about 15 minutes. If you're willing to part with them, chocolate-covered  <b>pretzels</b> make ideal gifts for the holidays or special occasions. Once  <b>chocolate</b> is set and hardened, wrap  <b>pretzels</b> in  <b>cellophane</b> or  <b>plastic wrap</b> and secure with a  <b>festive</b>  <b>bow</b>. Or carefully fill a  <b>glass</b> jar with  <b>pretzels</b>, cover and decorate the top with ribbons, bows or fabric.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel" cat="bakery	food	loanword">Pretzels</a>  will keep at least a month when sealed or  <b>refrigerated</b>, but it's likely they won't last that long.
