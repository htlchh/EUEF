Stephen Colvin, an executive who oversaw  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot" cat="property	forum">Gamespot</a> , is out of the company, a  <b>tipster</b> tells us. Gerstmann's firing came after a negative review of an  <b>advertiser</b>'s game, which made him a cause célèbre among gamers.
