"The sole target of a possible cross-border operation will be the  <b>terrorist organisation</b>,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan" cat="">Erdogan</a>  told lawmakers from his ruling party, referring to the outlawed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers_Party" cat="">Kurdistan Workers' Party</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers_Party" cat="">PKK</a> ). Such an operation will be carried out "if need be, at the right time and under the right conditions with a view of obtaining the right result,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan" cat="">Erdogan</a>  added. He said a possible incursion would not target either  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraqi</a>  civilians or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> 's unity and integrity, but underlined that his government was determined to protect itself. " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" cat="country	nation	republic	state	member">Turkey</a>  is in a position of  <b>self-defence</b> when it comes to  <b>terrorism</b>. Everyone should understand this,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan" cat="">Erdogan</a>  said a day before  <b>parliament</b> is set to vote on extending by one-year the government's mandate to order cross-border strikes. The Turkish leaders also warned  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people" cat="group	community	person	section">Iraqi Kurds</a>  to side with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" cat="country	nation	republic	state	member">Turkey</a>  in combating  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers_Party" cat="">PKK</a>  rebels who use the autonomous north of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  as a  <b>springboard</b> for attacks in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" cat="country	nation	republic	state	member">Turkish</a>  territory. "The best choice for the regional administration of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurdistan" cat="politics">northern Iraq</a>  is to cooperate with us against  <b>terrorist</b> elements because the  <b>terrorist</b> organisation is a cause of regional unrest and tension,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan" cat="">Erdogan</a>  said. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers_Party" cat="">PKK</a>  is considered a  <b>terrorist group</b> by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States–European_Union_relations" cat="">United States and the European Union</a> . "It is inevitable for those who cannot put a barrier between themselves and  <b>terrorism</b>, to be adversely affected by the struggle against  <b>terrorism</b>," he added.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" cat="country	nation	republic	state	member">Turkey</a>  has long accused the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people" cat="group	community	person	section">Iraqi Kurds</a>  of tolerating the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers_Party" cat="">PKK</a>  on their territory where, it says, the militants enjoy freedom of movement and easily obtain weapons and  <b>explosives</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraqi</a>  authorities have repeatedly pledged to curb the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers_Party" cat="">PKK</a> , but say the group takes refuge in mountainous regions to which access is difficult. In what was the bloodiest fighting this year,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers_Party" cat="">PKK</a>  rebels, backed by heavy weapons fire from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurdistan" cat="politics">northern Iraq</a> , attacked a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Armed_Forces" cat="">Turkish military</a>  outpost close to the border on Friday, killing 17 soldiers. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Armed_Forces" cat="">Turkish army</a>  has carried out four cross-border  <b>air raids</b> since then, hitting at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers_Party" cat="">PKK</a>  targets in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurdistan" cat="politics">northern Iraq</a> .
