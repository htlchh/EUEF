This discovery puts an end to a yearlong discussion on the nature of this object, which started with the detection of a red object close to the  <b>brown dwarf</b>.<br><br>In February and March of this year, the  <b>astronomers</b> took new images of the  <b>young brown</b>  <b>dwarf</b> and its  <b>giant planet</b> companion with the state-of-the-science  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Counties" cat="group	county">NACO</a>  instrument on the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory" cat="observatory	organization	establishment">European Southern Observatory</a> 's (ESO) Very Large Telescope in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile" cat="state	country	colony	nation">northern Chile</a> . The  <b>planet</b> is near the southern  <b>constellation</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(constellation)" cat="constellation">Hydra</a>  and approximately 200  <b>light years</b> from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="planet">Earth</a> .<br><br>"Our new images show convincingly that this really is a  <b>planet</b>, the first  <b>planet</b> that has ever been imaged outside of our  <b>solar system</b>," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaels" cat="group	person">Gael</a>  Chauvin,  <b>astronomer</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory" cat="observatory	organization	establishment">ESO</a>  and leader of the team of  <b>astronomers</b> who conducted the study.<br><br>"The two objects — the  <b>giant planet</b> and the  <b>young brown</b>  <b>dwarf</b>  <b>—</b> are moving together; we have observed them for a year, and the new images essentially confirm our  <b>2004</b>  <b>finding</b>," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Zuckerman" cat="">Benjamin Zuckerman</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" cat="university	institution">UCLA</a>   <b>professor</b> of  <b>physics</b> and  <b>astronomy</b>, member of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" cat="agency">NASA</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Astrobiology_Institute" cat="program">Astrobiology Institute</a> , and a member of the team. "I'm  <b>more than 99 percent</b> confident. This is also the first time that a  <b>planet</b> outside of our  <b>solar system</b> has been detected far from a  <b>star</b> or  <b>brown dwarf</b>  <b>—</b>  <b>nearly</b> twice as far as the distance between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune" cat="planet	object">Neptune</a>  and the  <b>sun</b>."<br><br>Anne-Marie  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Louis_Lagrange" cat="mathematician	astronomer	person	analyst	member	burial	catholic	count	officiers	theorist">Lagrange</a> , another member of the team from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble" cat="city	companion">Grenoble</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory" cat="observatory">Observatory</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" cat="nation	country	state	republic	member">France</a> , said, "Our discovery represents a first step towards one of the most important goals of modern astrophysics: to characterize the physical structure and  <b>chemical composition</b> of giant and, eventually, terrestrial-like  <b>planets</b>."<br><br>Last September, the same team of  <b>astronomers</b> reported a faint reddish speck of light in the close vicinity of a  <b>young brown</b>  <b>dwarf</b>. The feeble object, now called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2M1207b" cat="planet	exoplanets">2M1207b</a> , is more than  <b>100 times</b> fainter than the  <b>brown dwarf</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2M1207" cat="system">2M1207A</a> . The  <b>spectrum</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2M1207b" cat="planet	exoplanets">2M1207b</a>  presents a strong signature of  <b>water</b>  <b>molecules</b>, thereby confirming that it must be cold. Based on the  <b>infrared</b> colors and the spectral data,  <b>evolutionary model</b> calculations led to the conclusion that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2M1207b" cat="planet	exoplanets">2M1207b</a>  is a five-Jupiter-mass  <b>planet</b>. Its  <b>mass</b> can be estimated also by use of a different method of analysis, which focuses on the strength of its  <b>gravitational field</b>; this technique suggests that the  <b>mass</b> might be even less than that of five  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiters" cat="group">Jupiters</a> .<br><br>At the time of its discovery in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2004" cat="">April 2004</a> , it was impossible to prove that the faint source is not a background object (such as an unusual  <b>galaxy</b> or a peculiar cool  <b>star</b> with abnormal  <b>infrared</b> colors), even though this appeared very unlikely. Observations with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" cat="satellite	experiment	accident	project">Hubble Space Telescope</a> , obtained in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2004" cat="">August 2004</a> , corroborated the VLT/NACO observations, but were taken too soon after the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Counties" cat="group	county">NACO</a>  ones to demonstrate conclusively that the faint source is a  <b>planet</b>.<br><br>The new observations show with high confidence that the two objects are moving together and hence are  <b>gravitationally bound</b>.<br><br>The paper describing this research has been accepted for publication in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_and_Astrophysics" cat="journal">Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> , a premier  <b>journal</b> in  <b>astronomy</b>.<br><br>"Given the rather unusual properties of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2M1207" cat="system">2M1207</a>  system, the  <b>giant planet</b> most probably did not form like the  <b>planets</b> in our  <b>solar system</b>," Chauvin said. "Instead it must have formed the same way our  <b>sun</b> formed, by a  <b>one-step</b>  <b>gravitational collapse</b> of a  <b>cloud</b> of  <b>gas and dust</b>."<br><br>The same European/American team has had another paper just accepted for publication in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_and_Astrophysics" cat="journal">Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> . This paper reports the imaging discovery with the same VLT/NACO instrumentation of a lightweight companion to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_Pictoris" cat="variable	exoplanets	object	star	system">AB Pictoris</a> , a young  <b>star</b> located about 150  <b>light years</b> from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="planet">Earth</a> . The estimated  <b>mass</b> of the companion is between 13 and 14 times the  <b>mass</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter" cat="planet">Jupiter</a> , which places the companion right on the borderline between massive  <b>planets</b> and the lowest  <b>mass</b> brown dwarfs.<br><br>"Remarkably, this companion is located very far from its host  <b>star</b>  <b>—</b> about nine times farther from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_Pictoris" cat="variable	exoplanets	object	star	system">AB Pictoris</a>  than  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune" cat="planet	object">Neptune</a>  is from the  <b>sun</b>," Zuckerman said. Nothing so far from its  <b>star</b> has ever been seen in a  <b>planetary system</b> before, he added.<br><br>Brown dwarfs, the  <b>missing link</b> between  <b>gas giant</b>  <b>planets</b> like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter" cat="planet">Jupiter</a>  and small, low‑mass stars, are failed stars about the size of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter" cat="planet">Jupiter</a> , with a much larger  <b>mass</b>  <b>—</b> but not quite large enough to become stars. Like the  <b>sun</b> and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter" cat="planet">Jupiter</a> , they are composed mainly of  <b>hydrogen gas</b>, perhaps with swirling  <b>cloud</b> belts. Unlike the  <b>sun</b>, they cannot  <b>fuse</b>  <b>protons</b> to  <b>helium</b>  <b>nuclei</b> as their primary  <b>internal energy</b> source, and they emit almost no  <b>visible light</b>.<br><br>Web sites for reference:<br><br>ESO: http://www.eso.org/<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" cat="university	institution">UCLA</a>  Astronomy and Astrophysics: http://www.astro.ucla.edu<br>
