  | | Tuberville, Petrino past Jetgate and say they have no ill feelings toward each other Tuesday, October 07, 2008 CHARLES GOLDBERG News staff writer  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football" cat="team	club">AUBURN</a>  --  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Tuberville" cat="coach	player	alumnus	person	member	safety">Tommy Tuberville</a>  would like nothing better than to beat his perceived coaching nemesis in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan-Hare_Stadium" cat="">Jordan-Hare Stadium</a>  on Saturday. But really, he has already  <b>exacted</b> the best kind of revenge on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Petrino" cat="coach	player	person	quarterback	sportspeople">Bobby Petrino</a>  and his detractors. Less than a year after Petrino almost replaced Tuberville as  <b>head coach</b> at Auburn in a backroom deal - remember Jetgate? - Tuberville and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football" cat="team	club">Auburn</a>  put together the best season in school history with a 13-0 record. Now, almost five years after the failed  <b>2003</b>  <b>coup</b>, Tuberville, still the  <b>head coach</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_University" cat="institution	university">Auburn</a> , and Petrino, now the  <b>head coach</b> at Arkansas, will meet for the first time and with no outward sign of animosity. "Business is business," Tuberville said Monday. Both coaches have been asked about their face-to-face meeting in  <b>press conferences</b> this week. Tuberville cut short a Petrino question Sunday with a "don't even try" to go there comment. Petrino ducked the issue Monday. "That's such a  <b>long time</b> ago and something we've all put behind us," Petrino said. They may have put it behind them, but, just to make sure  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers" cat="club	team">Auburn</a>  hasn't, Arkansas put in Petrino's five-year contract that he can't take another job at an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference" cat="sport	establishment">SEC West</a>  school. Tuberville detractors, take notice.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued" cat="album">CONTINUED</a>  1 | | MORE  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport" cat="sport">SPORTS</a>   <b>•</b>  <b>•</b>  <b>•</b>  <b>•</b> ©  <b>2008</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birmingham_News" cat="newspaper">The Birmingham News</a> .
