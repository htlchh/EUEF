"It was a really nice day for  <b>sailing</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego,_California" cat="">San Diego</a>  ," tactician  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kostecki" cat="sailor	person	racer	medalist">John Kostecki</a>  said after the triple-hulled boat, which measures 90  <b>feet</b> by 90  <b>feet</b>, returned to its berth around  <b>sunset</b>. "We had like 16 to 18  <b>knots</b> of  <b>wind</b>, which is pretty unusual for around here." With the fate of the next  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Cup" cat="establishment	trophy	race">America's Cup</a>  tied up in a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  court,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Oracle_Racing" cat="team">BMW Oracle Racing</a>  continues to test the black craft that dwarfs its crew. It was launched in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacortes,_Washington" cat="city	place">Anacortes</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Supreme_Court" cat="justice	court">Wash.</a> , in late August and underwent initial testing on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound" cat="estuary	section">Puget Sound</a>  . It was shipped to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego,_California" cat="">San Diego</a>   which was home to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Cup" cat="establishment	trophy	race">America's Cup</a>  from  <b>1987</b> to  <b>1995</b>  for two months of  <b>sailing</b> on the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" cat="">Pacific Ocean</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostecki" cat="">Kostecki</a>  said Tuesday's session, which included  <b>sailing</b> into waters off  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" cat="nation	country	state	empire	words	colony">Mexico</a> , was a success, especially with the  <b>temperature</b> pushing 90 degrees. "It was nice," he said. "The weather was spectacular.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopefully" cat="">Hopefully</a>  we can get more days like today. I know they're hard to come by. It was a perfect day. The  <b>wind</b> was really nice; nice and steady and a fair amount of it."  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostecki" cat="">Kostecki</a>  said the boat reached speeds of 22 to 23  <b>knots</b>. "We weren't even pushing it," he said. "We weren't really full-on, then, either. I think normally in that condition we could get it up a lot faster, up to 28 or 30  <b>knots</b>." The  <b>trimaran</b> has a space-age look and is enormous. It would cover the  <b>diamond</b> on a  <b>big league baseball</b> field and is just a few  <b>feet</b> shorter than an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association" cat="league">NBA</a>  court. The  <b>mast</b> is 158  <b>feet</b> tall and the  <b>mainsail</b> is approximately 5,300  <b>square feet</b>. It's such a high-performance boat that the sailors wear helmets and  <b>life vests</b>, which aren't normally part of the  <b>apparel</b> for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Cup" cat="establishment	trophy	race">America's Cup</a>  crews . "It makes me feel a lot more comfortable," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostecki" cat="">Kostecki</a> , who likens the crew to  <b>test pilots</b>. "I thought about it a couple of times today, 'Well, I'm glad I <b>'ve</b> got this gear on.' " Even with all the time, effort and an estimated $10 million that have gone into it, the  <b>trimaran</b> might not get the chance to sail for the oldest trophy in international sports.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Oracle_Racing" cat="team">BMW Oracle Racing</a>  , owned by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation" cat="company	partner">Oracle</a>   <b>software</b>  <b>boss</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison" cat="businesspeople	billionaire	aviator	employee	executive	person	jew	adoptee	racer	sailor">Larry Ellison</a>  , has been battling two-time defending  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Cup" cat="establishment	trophy	race">America's Cup</a>  champion  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alinghi" cat="vessel	team	defender">Alinghi</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" cat="country	state">Switzerland</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_New_York" cat="court">New York courts</a>  for more than a year in an attempt to become Challenger of Record and help set the rules for the next  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Cup" cat="establishment	trophy	race">America's Cup</a>  .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Oracle_Racing" cat="team">BMW Oracle Racing</a>  initially secured a court ruling that it was the rightful Challenger of Record.
