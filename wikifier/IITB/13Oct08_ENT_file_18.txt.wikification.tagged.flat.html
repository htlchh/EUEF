Here is an article after seeing them at their show in Chicago:<br><br>During TOFOG’s live show at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Blues" cat="blues	venue">House of Blues</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" cat="place	settlement	community	city	seats">Chicago</a>  on Monday, August 18, 2003,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe" cat="actor	winner	person	student	singer	administrator	recipient	citizen">Russell Crowe</a>  held out the  <b>microphone</b> so that the women closest to the stage, who were singing, could be heard.  Soon after,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe" cat="actor	winner	person	student	singer	administrator	recipient	citizen">Russell Crowe</a>  said, “Now the men.”  Not a note from the few men was heard, or maybe some did sing but it was far in the back where they couldn’t be heard.  This kind of  <b>humor</b>, if it was meant to be that, shows Crowe’s depth and his understanding of how his presence affects his band.<br><br>So after my husband, Bryan Rundell, and I attended the concert, I decided to pay attention, listen, and write down what my husband thought of the concert for a male point of view.  His views come from someone who is honest, who has played  <b>guitar</b> and  <b>bass</b> in bands for many years, and who has attended a lot of concerts in his earlier days.  That said, here are some words from a man’s point of view:<br><br>“He put on one  <b>hell</b> of a show.  Powerful voice.   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe" cat="actor	winner	person	student	singer	administrator	recipient	citizen">Russell Crowe</a>  can sing.  The band was great.  They were mixed well.  Lyrics are good.  He looked happy up on stage.   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_rock" cat="genre">Folk rock</a> .  The two encores were long.  Russell Crowe is a legitimate talent as a musician.”<br><br>After hearing these words, I could have debated with my husband to the point where we end up concluding, “I agree with this part of your view but not this part” or where we settle and “agree to disagree.”  However, this is one of those special instances when husband and wife agree.<br>
