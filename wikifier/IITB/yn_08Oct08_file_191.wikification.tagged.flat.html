By ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune" cat="newspaper	recipient">Star Tribune</a>  Last update: October 7, 2008 - 11:56 PM Featured comment Let's do the  <b>math</b>. Erickson has taken two guided  <b>moose</b> hunts to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a> . These hunts probably average about twelve to thirteen thousand dollars each. Add additional costs of hotels, air fair, etc. and this guy has supported the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a>   <b>economy</b> to the tune of twenty five to thirty thousand. All to hunt an  <b>animal</b> that is not exactly on the  <b>endangered species list</b>. I believe non-resident  <b>moose</b>  <b>hunting</b> licences are four hundred dollars. With incidentals he has funded the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNR_(House)" cat="episode">DNR</a>  by probably at least a thousand dollars. To those who are critical, only one question. How much have you contributed? 29 comments |  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-game_hunting" cat="">BIG-GAME HUNTING</a>  Related Content More from The  <b>bull moose</b> that emerged from the thick  <b>underbrush</b> 260 yards distant along a  <b>clear stream</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Interior" cat="region">Alaska interior</a>  took Brad Erickson by surprise. But then everything had been a surprise. The  <b>moose</b>, yes. Also the earlier re-connection with an uncle Erickson hadn't seen in 12 years. And, when that uncle died, enough money set aside in his will for Erickson to do what his uncle had always wanted to do, but never had. "I saw the  <b>bull</b>. It had a huge  <b>rack</b>. But I didn't have time to count brow  <b>tines</b>, to see for sure if he was legal. I fell to one  <b>knee</b>, found the  <b>moose</b> in my scope, and shot,'' said Erickson, 47, of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnetonka,_Minnesota" cat="">Minnetonka</a> . Just as quickly, the  <b>animal</b> disappeared in the brush. Immediately, an outpouring of thoughts descended upon Erickson. Everything had happened in a rush. Did the  <b>bull</b>'s  <b>antlers</b> possess the necessary four brow tines on one side to make it legal? If not, was the inside spread of its  <b>antlers</b> at least 50 inches, another legal benchmark? And what of his guide, the 21-year-old named Jake? This was their  <b>sixth day</b> in the bush together, and the first chance they had had to wash up. They were splashing  <b>water</b> on their faces when Jake looked upstream and saw a  <b>cow moose</b>. Until then, they had seen only one  <b>moose</b>, a legal  <b>bull</b>. But nothing great. Erickson had passed. "When Jake saw that  <b>cow</b>, he whispered to me and I went for my  <b>rifle</b>,'' Erickson said. Erickson, a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennepin_County_Sheriff's_Office" cat="department	agency">Hennepin County Sheriff</a> 's Department  <b>sergeant</b> who for seven years led that agency's  <b>sniper</b> squad, is  <b>firearms</b> savvy. "After the  <b>cow</b> came out, the  <b>bull</b> followed it into the  <b>stream</b>. I went to a  <b>knee</b> and shot. Then Jake said to me, 'I didn't tell you to shoot. I just wanted you to see the  <b>cow</b>,' '' Erickson said. Rewind to  <b>2006</b>. John Svegal, Erickson's uncle and a retired  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell" cat="company	avionics	component	contractor	system	corporation	manufacturer">Honeywell</a>   <b>engineer</b>, dies of  <b>cancer</b>. A few months later, Svegal's wife, Betty, also dies. Both were in their 80s. The relationship between Svegal, a decorated  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" cat="war	conflict	1930s	1940s">World War II</a>  veteran, and Erickson was special. Though for one 12-year stretch the two hadn't seen one another, it was Svegal who had taken Erickson  <b>hunting</b> as a boy, teaching him that you don't shoot what you don't eat. It was also Svegal, a  <b>dog</b> lover, who, after the pair had  <b>reconnected</b> in  <b>1987</b>, occasionally sneaked Erickson's  <b>law</b> enforcement  <b>narcotics</b>  <b>dog</b> treats he wasn't supposed to have. It was also Svegal who, in his last days, while recounting his few life regrets to Erickson, revealed he had always wanted to hunt in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a> . But never had. Doubtless, Svegal knew Erickson's chances of  <b>hunting</b> there on a  <b>law enforcement officer</b>'s salary weren't good, either. So when he died, Svegal left enough money in his will for his nephew to hunt in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a> . The will could have been changed by Erickson's aunt after her husband died. But it wasn't. Erickson flew to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a>  for the first time a year ago last month. He wanted a  <b>moose</b>. "I didn't get one,'' he said. "But I did carry my uncle's  <b>photograph</b> with me, and one day I climbed the highest hill in the area, and I put his photo under a  <b>rock</b>. You're probably not supposed to do that, but I did it anyway.'' Returning to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul" cat="">Twin Cities</a> , Erickson met two hunters who told him about Joe Schuster, a former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota" cat="state">Minnesotan</a>  who is a reputable  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a>  guide. With enough of his uncle's money to hunt in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a>  again, Erickson booked a return trip. "I worked security for 12 to 16 hours a day at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention" cat="event	convention">Republican National Convention</a> , and after that, I was ready for a break,'' he said. "When the convention ended, I flew to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a>  to hunt.'' But after six days in the bush, Erickson had yet to pull the trigger. He didn't have to kill something to honor his uncle's memory. Were that the case, he would have already drawn down on a  <b>grizzly</b> he and Jake had  <b>stalked</b>. "I don't have anything against killing  <b>grizzlies</b>,'' he said. "But I have never forgotten my uncle telling me not to kill something unless you intend to eat it.'' Then, suddenly, the  <b>cow moose</b> appeared.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Followed" cat="">Followed</a>  by the  <b>bull</b>. And the shot. What -- or who -- had pushed the animals into the open? "When we walked upstream, we found the  <b>bull</b> 40 yards from where he was when I shot, lying in the  <b>water</b>,'' Erickson said. "He had tried to get back across the  <b>river</b>, following the  <b>cow</b>. I hit him right behind the shoulder, where I had aimed.'' The  <b>bull</b> likely will be recorded as one of the top 15 moose ever killed in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" cat="list	region">North America</a> . Its inside spread measured 74¼ inches, with six brow tines to a side. Its  <b>antlers</b> bore 32 points and a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boone_and_Crockett_Club" cat="record	organization">Boone and Crockett</a>  green score of  <b>239</b>. Said Erickson: "I believe my uncle had something to do with that  <b>bull</b> coming out of the brush.''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Anderson" cat="driver	person">Dennis Anderson</a>   <b>•</b> Comment on this story | | Comments are subject to the site's and do not necessarily reflect the opinion or approval of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune" cat="newspaper	recipient">the Star Tribune</a> .
