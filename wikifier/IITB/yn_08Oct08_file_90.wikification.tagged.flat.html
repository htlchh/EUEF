More Photos CHANNEL ISLANDS  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park" cat="area	parks">NATIONAL PARK</a>  –Only my footprints marked the  <b>wet sand</b> along Water Canyon Beach. Only my ears heard the  <b>wail</b> of  <b>sea gulls</b> resonating off the  <b>sandstone</b> cliffs above. Only my eyes saw a bright  <b>orange</b>  <b>starfish</b> rising and falling with the  <b>tide</b> as the sea battered its rocky ledge. I found  <b>solitude</b>,  <b>adventure</b> and an unspoiled, world-class beach only  <b>26 miles</b> from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Los Angeles</a>  megalopolis. The  <b>cacophony</b> of screaming horns, circling  <b>helicopters</b>, bleating phones. None of those could  <b>follow</b> me here. I was off the grid. My  <b>nirvana</b> was an isolated  <b>beach</b> on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa_Island,_California" cat="site">Santa Rosa Island</a> , part of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_National_Park" cat="area	reserves	parks">Channel Islands National Park</a> . The five rocky outcrop-pings off  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California" cat="region">Southern California</a>  are so wild and isolated that they’re often called America’s Galapagos. The park, accessible only by boat or plane, draws so few people that it ranks as one of the least-visited in the country; although it is within 60 miles of 18 million people, only about 80,000 visit each year. Seclusion is not only possible but also probable along its 175 miles of coastline. In actuality, two of the islands are easy to reach by  <b>ferry</b>. And those who make the trip find a place that is worlds apart from the mainland. An unspoiled land with an  <b>incredible</b> array of  <b>plants and animals</b> found nowhere else. An adventure-in-the-making where unparalleled  <b>kayaking</b> and  <b>diving</b> await. A place where  <b>hikers</b>, sailors,  <b>fishermen</b> and campers find  <b>first-rate</b>  <b>wilderness</b> activities. I discovered the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands" cat="">Channel Islands</a>  more than a decade ago. Since then, I’ve collected the islands the way some people collect  <b>fine art</b>. There are eight in the chain, but only five comprise the park ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catalina_Island,_California" cat="area">Catalina</a>  is a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_of_California" cat="">Channel Island</a> , but is not part of the park.) The two inner islands,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacapa_Island" cat="">Anacapa</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Island" cat="">Santa Cruz</a> , are closest to the mainland and easy to reach on scheduled boat trips. The three outer islands –Santa Rosa,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" cat="seats	place	city">Santa Barbara</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_Island" cat="island">San Miguel</a>  –can be difficult.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_service" cat="boat">Boat service</a>  is infrequent and subject to mercurial weather and sea conditions. Even if you reach  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" cat="seats	place	city">Santa Barbara</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_Island" cat="island">San Miguel</a> , landings can be wet and wild rides through the surf because docks are nonexistent. I finally bagged my fifth  <b>park island</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" cat="seats	place	city">Santa Barbara</a> , this spring after several years of failed attempts. But my collection has more tangible rewards than just adding another  <b>island</b> to my  <b>life list</b>. The channel that separates the islands from the coast is a  <b>waterworld</b> of wondrous sights: pods of  <b>whales</b> gliding through moonlit seas, boisterous schools of  <b>dolphins</b> wave-hopping in search of  <b>prey</b>, squadrons of  <b>brown pelicans</b> patrolling rocky shores. The islands rose from the  <b>ocean floor</b> millions of years ago, born of  <b>volcanic activity</b> and  <b>plate tectonics</b>; they lie in a region between the mainland and the  <b>ocean depths</b> called the  <b>continental shelf</b>. Four of the park islands are strung out in a line; at one time, they were a single  <b>large island</b>. The fifth, tiny  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" cat="seats	place	city">Santa Barbara</a> , is 60 miles south. The easiest way to visit is by boat with Island  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers" cat="sport	company	packer	club	team">Packers</a>  ( ), a family-owned service that’s staffed by avid  <b>ocean</b> lovers. Volunteer  <b>naturalists</b> accompany each trip, leading hikes and explaining  <b>marine</b> and  <b>island life</b>. The other ways to reach the islands can be mini-adventures in themselves, as I found when I visited Santa Rosa in May. The  <b>marine layer</b> had just lifted when our twin-engine plane powered along the  <b>runway</b> at tiny  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarillo_Airport" cat="airport">Camarillo Airport</a>  and rose noisily over fields full of ripening  <b>strawberries</b>. The 10-seater headed out to sea. I had joined a group of Los Angelesarea buddies headed to Santa Rosa for a day of  <b>surf fishing</b>. They arranged the trip with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands" cat="">Channel Island</a>  Aviation ( ), which provides  <b>air transportation</b> to the  <b>island</b>. The round-trip flight, about 25 minutes each way, cost $159 and gave me a bird’s-eye view of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_Channel" cat="">Santa Barbara Channel</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacapa_Island" cat="">Anacapa</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Island" cat="">Santa Cruz</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa_Island,_California" cat="site">Santa Rosa</a>  islands. We bounced around in the sky, buffeted by morning currents, buzzed over a  <b>pod</b> of  <b>whales</b> headed north and then bumped down on a  <b>graded dirt</b>  <b>runway</b>. While the  <b>fishing</b> buddies practiced casting, I had  <b>nearly</b> six hours to wander.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa,_California" cat="seats	city	place">Santa Rosa</a> , the second largest of the islands, is in the outer waters, which means the weather can be devilish. High winds are the main problem, but damp, chilly conditions can be another deterrent. I hiked into Cherry Canyon along a 3z-mile trail that’s popular with  <b>day-trippers</b>. Clusters of flaming  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Paintbrush" cat="">Indian paintbrush</a>  lined the  <b>switchbacks</b> as I climbed up a steep  <b>canyon</b>, passing small groves of  <b>live oaks</b> and  <b>manzanita</b>. At the top of a ridge, miles of golden  <b>grasses</b> stretched to the sea, waving slightly in the breeze. There was no sign of life, other than the white  <b>hull</b> and silvery  <b>mast</b> of a  <b>sailboat</b> at  <b>anchor</b> in Bechers Bay far below. Eventually, the trail took me to Santa Rosa’s campground, where each site has an  <b>ocean</b> view. (Camping is permitted on all the islands with reservations, (877) 444-6777 or .) The  <b>campground</b> had improved dramatically since my last visit four years ago.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet" cat="">Flush toilets</a>  and a solar  <b>shower</b> had been added, along with  <b>sturdy</b>  <b>windbreak</b> shelters at each site, making it the cushiest  <b>campground</b> in the park. But no campers were there to enjoy the  <b>plush</b> digs. I continued my trek, making my way to Water Canyon Beach. I had saved this, the best, for last. I knew from my earlier visit that it was a  <b>stunner</b>. Ranger Mark Senning, who has made his home on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa,_California" cat="seats	city	place">Santa Rosa</a>  for 10 years, calls it “world class,” and I agree. A lazy line of white  <b>surf</b> curled along a  <b>beautifully</b> shaped  <b>bay</b>. Dunes soared 40  <b>feet</b>, the surface unmarked except for tiny waves etched by the  <b>wind</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandpipers" cat="group">Sandpipers</a>  scurried along the  <b>beach</b>, sea  <b>gulls</b> surfed air currents, a curious  <b>seal</b> poked its head out of the  <b>water</b> offshore. I knew the  <b>surf fishermen</b> were out there somewhere, but with five miles of coastline, I didn’t care. For a few moments, the  <b>beach</b> belonged to me. I made several trips to the islands for this story; most were aboard Island Packers’ boats. But the most exhilarating was on a 53-foot J160, a high-performance  <b>sloop</b> named  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sirena" cat="">La Sirena</a> . I had joined a tour group put together by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness" cat="">Wilderness</a>  Inquiry, and the ride was part of a three-day sail and  <b>kayak</b> package to Santa Cruz, the largest of the islands.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness" cat="">Wilderness</a>  Inquiry, a nonprofit, offers outdoor adventure trips “for people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities” ( ). What that means is that some of its campers are  <b>disabled</b>. Nondisabled campers  <b>pitch</b> in to help. Other groups sponsor trips to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_of_California" cat="">Channel Islands</a>  too, including  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Club" cat="organization	dispute	organisation	group">the Sierra Club</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderhostel" cat="organization">Elderhostel</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_Botanic_Garden" cat="garden">Santa Barbara Botanical Garden</a>  and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Los Angeles</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audubon_Society" cat="partner	establishment	organization	center">Audubon Society</a> . The drawing card for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Wilderness" cat="battle">the Wilderness</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inquiry" cat="">Inquiry group</a>  was exploring Santa Cruz, known for its  <b>sea caves</b> and exciting  <b>kayaking</b> conditions. Of course, everyone expected to be hitting the  <b>water</b> on a warm, sunny day, not in a slow  <b>drizzle</b> with  <b>wind waves</b> kicking up whitecaps. The trip through the  <b>caves</b> was bracing but fun. And everyone made it back to shore in one piece. Scorpion Ranch, on the eastern end of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_Island" cat="">Santa Barbara Island</a> , is the most popular stop for those who visit the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_of_California" cat="">Channel Islands</a> ; it sometimes receives as many as 150 visitors on a  <b>summer day</b>. I didn’t find  <b>solitude</b>, but there were plenty of trails to hike, places to  <b>picnic</b> and campsites to try in a  <b>canyon</b> wooded with  <b>eucalyptus</b>. And I’ll never forget the  <b>sea caves</b>. Sea conditions were not as ideal in late May, when I joined a group of campers headed for San Miguel, 64 miles west of the mainland. Twelvefoot seas made the four-hour journey uncomfortable for many on board. Luckily, the weather was better on San Miguel. It offers good  <b>hiking</b> and, of course, lots of  <b>solitude</b>. Sixteen miles west of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California" cat="city	seats	place">Ventura</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" cat="state	colony">Calif.</a> , Anacapa’s three volcanic islets rise steeply from the sea, seeming to float on the  <b>horizon</b> like a distant  <b>mirage</b>. The name, in fact, is derived from a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumash_people" cat="tribe	indian	group	person">Chumash</a>  word for “mirage.” The rocky, treeless shores here have been  <b>eroded</b> by  <b>wind</b> and waves, creating towering sea cliffs,  <b>caves</b> and  <b>natural bridges</b>, including 40-foot-high  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Rock_(Mackinac_Island)" cat="property">Arch Rock</a> . We boarded the boat for the trip back to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California" cat="city	seats	place">Ventura</a>  in the late afternoon, and I took my  <b>usual</b> seat on the top deck, watching for  <b>marine life</b>. In the distance, I spotted a  <b>whale</b> breaching. I didn’t think much of it;  <b>whales</b> usually breach only a few times. By the time you reach them, they’re long gone. But this big boy of planet ocean hadn’t seen that script. He kept on breaching, propelling his 45-ton body out of the  <b>water</b> again and again. I counted as our boat neared. The  <b>whale</b>, a  <b>humpback</b>, kept flying out of the  <b>water</b>, then slapping back down in backward somersaults. Our  <b>captain</b> stopped so we could watch. Twenty times, 25 times. Other people on deck started to count with me. No one, including captain, crew or  <b>naturalist</b>, had seen anything like it, they said. When the  <b>whale</b> reached 40 jumps, the captain headed for home. I could see the  <b>acrobatic</b>  <b>whale</b> for a while, though, and before he faded from sight, I counted 49 breaches. I know this sounds like a  <b>whale</b> of a tale. But it’s not. It’s a true Channel Islands tale.
