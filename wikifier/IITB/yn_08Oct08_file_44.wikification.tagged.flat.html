(Gus Stuertze/For The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_News" cat="">Courier News</a> ) "My parents operated the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udina" cat="mountain">Udina</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(instrument)" cat="instrument">Triangle</a>  from  <b>1933</b> to  <b>1943</b>," Wesemann said. "It was a  <b>mom-and-pop</b> operation that included a gas station, tavern and restaurant." The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udina" cat="mountain">Udina</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle,_Virginia" cat="community	place">Triangle</a>  was located near the intersection of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_20" cat="highway">U.S. 20</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plank_road" cat="">Plank Road</a> . The  <b>gas station</b> and  <b>restaurant</b> were housed in one building. The family occupied the  <b>upstairs</b>  <b>living quarters</b>. Wesemann developed his love for music while he lived at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udina" cat="mountain">Udina</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(instrument)" cat="instrument">Triangle</a> . "A  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" cat="state	republic	country	member	nation">German</a>  band played in the  <b>restaurant</b> on Saturday nights until 1 a.m.," Wesemann said. "I slept  <b>upstairs</b> and heard the songs." Wesemann started to play the  <b>accordion</b> in  <b>1937</b> and has played it ever since. He has learned around 50 to 70 songs by  <b>ear</b>. Some of his favorite songs are the Barbara  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polka" cat="loanword	dance	form">Polka</a>  , The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz" cat="dance	form">Waltz</a>  You Saved for Me and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic" cat="song">Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>  . After he grew up, Wesemann served in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army" cat="unit	services">the U.S. Army</a>  for two years. He came home and operated the  <b>gas station</b> for four years while his parents rented the  <b>restaurant</b> and  <b>tavern</b>. The Wesemann family moved to a  <b>farm</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire" cat="county">Hampshire</a>  along  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_20" cat="highway">U.S. 20</a> . They also built a new  <b>service station</b> in  <b>1951</b>. The  <b>service station</b> was near  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Route_47" cat="highway">Illinois 47</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_20" cat="highway">U.S. 20</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Route_72" cat="highway">Illinois 72</a>  in the  <b>unincorporated area</b> known as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starks,_Illinois" cat="community	place">Starks</a> . The family called it Starks  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(instrument)" cat="instrument">Triangle</a> . The Starks Triangle gas/service station once owned by Wesemann is now called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starks,_Illinois" cat="community	place">Starks</a>  Corner. It is a BP gas station/convenience center that sells  <b>liquor</b>,  <b>beer</b>,  <b>soft drinks</b>,  <b>coffee</b>, some food and other items. Wesemann ran the  <b>service station</b> for 27 years. A little  <b>drive-in</b> on the corner of the station was run by Wesemann's brother, Alvin. "We never had  <b>self-service</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starks,_Illinois" cat="community	place">Starks</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(instrument)" cat="instrument">Triangle</a> ," he said. "We wouldn't let people put  <b>gas</b> in their cars or in a  <b>gas can</b> because it might cause a fire. It's humorous to me now to see well-dressed people filling their own cars." Wesemann said his parents gave him a half  <b>acre</b> to build a house. "I <b>'ve</b> lived in the house since  <b>1954</b>," he said. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starks,_Illinois" cat="community	place">Starks</a>  Triangle remains, but the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udina" cat="mountain">Udina</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(instrument)" cat="instrument">Triangle</a>  was torn down a few years ago when officials "modernized" the intersection. Wesemann retired from the  <b>service station</b> business in  <b>1978</b> and sold  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starks,_Illinois" cat="community	place">Starks</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(instrument)" cat="instrument">Triangle</a>  to a former employee. However, he has collections of  <b>tractors</b>, cars and " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroliana" cat="">Petroliana</a> " -- filling station  <b>memorabilia</b> -- to remind him of the way things used to be. Wesemann collects and restores  <b>tractors</b>. He has two from  <b>1929</b> and two from the 1930s. "My newest one is from  <b>1949</b>," he said. "It has only four speeds. I am going to try and fix it. Maybe I'll be in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival" cat="festival	holiday">Harvest Moon Festival</a>   <b>tractor</b>  <b>parade</b> next year." Wesemann attended the  <b>festival</b>, in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa" cat="republic	city	town	capital">Genoa</a> , this year. He entertained attendees on Main Street by playing his  <b>accordion</b>. For many years, he has played his  <b>accordion</b> at the annual  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sycamore,_Illinois" cat="seats	place	city">Sycamore</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(content_delivery)" cat="">Steam</a>  Show and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshing" cat="">Threshing</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_(gathering)" cat="competition	group">Bee</a> . He performs every Tuesday evening at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery" cat="bakery">Bake House</a>   <b>restaurant</b> in Hebron. "I <b>'ve</b> been doing that for five years," he said. "Anyone can play there. We <b>'ve</b> had  <b>bass horn</b>,  <b>button box</b>  <b>accordion</b>,  <b>harmonica</b>,  <b>banjo</b>, trumpet, sax and guitar players." A friend he used to perform with at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery" cat="bakery">Bake House</a>  is now living at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood" cat="">Rosewood</a>  Care Center in Elgin. "I played three times for him there," Wesemann said. "The director at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood" cat="">Rosewood</a>  asked if I could play for the residents. I will play there at 10 a.m. on Wednesday,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October" cat="month">Oct.</a>  15." In addition to collecting tractors, Wesemann likes cars and  <b>circus</b>  <b>memorabilia</b>. "I have the first car I ever bought, a  <b>1931</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_A_(1927)" cat="">Model A</a>  two-door," Wesemann said. "I bought it in  <b>1947</b>. It's still running." Wesemann is the secretary/treasurer of the local chapter of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus" cat="circus	arts	loanword">Circus</a>  Fans Association of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">America</a> . "I <b>'ve</b> been a member since  <b>1964</b>," he said. "We try to help  <b>circuses</b> coming to  <b>town</b> by telling them where they can get things fixed and where local doctors are. The  <b>circus</b> is a very complex business. They set up a  <b>tent</b> every day." couriernewsonline.com: | | | | | Courier News: | Affiliates: | | | | | | Express Links: | | | | | | | © Copyright  <b>2008</b> Digital  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" cat="place	settlement	community	city	seats">Chicago</a> , Inc. |  <b>ý</b> ý
