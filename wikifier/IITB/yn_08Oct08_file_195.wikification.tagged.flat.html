Beckemeier Conservation Area ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Jackson_(MacGyver)" cat="character	farmer">Harry Jackson</a>  Jr./P-D) By  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Post-Dispatch" cat="post	newspaper	publication">ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH</a>  10/08/2008 In the midst of the urban  <b>landscape</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield,_Missouri" cat="city">Chesterfield</a>  is 54 acres of thick brush,  <b>grass</b> and enough trees that even 100 yards from the parking lot you're in  <b>cicada</b>  <b>heaven</b>. Where: West  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri" cat="establishment	county">St. Louis County</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive" cat="plant	tree	loanword">Olive</a>  Boulevard west of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladue,_Missouri" cat="city">Ladue</a>  Road. Surface of trail: Packed dirt. How long: One-half mile loop. Difficulty: A long descent and rise, but the trail is smooth. Description: About 100 yards into the area, the sounds from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive" cat="plant	tree	loanword">Olive</a>  Boulevard disappear, replaced by  <b>cicadas</b> and chirps. From the  <b>parking lot</b> to the loop's halfway point, the trail descends about 60  <b>feet</b> down a slope. And then the trail goes back up. Once the  <b>leaves</b> fall, the vista will reveal a spectacular view of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River_Valley" cat="region">Missouri River Valley</a> . Can be used for: Walking,  <b>nature study</b>,  <b>bird watching</b>. No bikes or  <b>horses</b>. User's note: It's a  <b>paradise</b> for walkers who like  <b>privacy</b> as well as photographers, nature lovers and  <b>bird watchers</b>. But, cover up and wear  <b>mosquito</b> repellent. It's  <b>buggy</b> and plenty of  <b>poison ivy</b> lurks in the shadows. Don't tackle the trail at evening  <b>twilight</b> until you're familiar enough to get caught in the dark, where the  <b>tree canopy</b> can obscure the lighting. Wheelchair accessible: No. Parking: One small lot at the  <b>trailhead</b>. Dogs: Leashed. Keep them close and make sure they <b>'ve</b> been tick-proofed. The park has  <b>coyotes</b>. Facilities: No water or restrooms.
