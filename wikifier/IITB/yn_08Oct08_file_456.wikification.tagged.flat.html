Then came October, and another big chill. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim" cat="angel	team	club">Los Angeles Angels</a>  seemed to have it all: a powerful lineup strengthened by newcomers  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii_Hunter" cat="person	player	star	winner	angel">Torii Hunter</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Teixeira" cat="star	person	player	sportspeople	champion	angel	winner	hunter">Mark Teixeira</a>  , an impressive rotation headed by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lackey" cat="person	player	champion	pitcher	angel">John Lackey</a>  , and a  <b>bullpen</b> anchored by record-setting closer  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Rodriguez_(baseball)" cat="">Francisco Rodriguez</a>  . They won 100 games for the first time in  <b>franchise</b> history, with eight of those victories coming in their nine meetings with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox" cat="team	club	winner	sox">the Boston Red Sox</a>  , and  <b>baseball</b> observers praised  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angels" cat="">the Angels</a>  as a team that did the little things correctly. All that wasn't enough. The teams with the best record in each league both flopped in the first-round, with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs" cat="club	team	subsidiary	company">Chicago Cubs</a>  (97-64) swept by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" cat="club	team">the Los Angeles Dodgers</a>  . For the third time in four years,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angels" cat="">the Angels</a>  went cold against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox" cat="team	club	winner	sox">the Red Sox</a>  in the first round of the  <b>playoffs</b>, this time often freezing up with men on base. They managed to win  <b>just one</b> game against the team that has become their post-season nemesis, and their  <b>hopes</b> of bringing the series back to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California" cat="city	place">Anaheim</a>  for a fifth and deciding game essentially ended with a failed  <b>squeeze bunt</b>, of all things. "We played much better this series than going back to '04 or '07 against them,"  <b>manager</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Scioscia" cat="player	catholic	sportspeople	coach	manager	angel	star	person	catcher	alumnus">Mike Scioscia</a>  said. Indeed, since they were swept by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox" cat="team	club	winner	sox">the Red Sox</a>  in the first round in both those years.

The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim" cat="angel	team	club">Angels</a>  made their only trip to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series" cat="event">World Series</a>  in  <b>2002</b>, when they were a  <b>wild card</b> , and beat  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco,_California" cat="">San Francisco</a>  in seven games. Owner  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Moreno" cat="">Arte Moreno</a>  and  <b>general manager</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Reagins" cat="person	manager	executive	angel">Tony Reagins</a>  face some big decisions: Do they exercise options on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero" cat="person	player	angel	star">Vladimir Guerrero</a>  (US$15 million),  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garret_Anderson" cat="player	person	angel	sportspeople	fielder	star">Garret Anderson</a>  ($14 million) and Lackey ($9 million). Do they try to re-sign Teixeira, who was brought in for the last two months of the season and is eligible for  <b>free agency</b>? Do they attempt to keep Rodriguez, who set a  <b>major league</b> regular-season record with 62 saves but gave up a game-deciding, two-run homer to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Drew" cat="person	player	winner	star">J.D. Drew</a>  in Game 2? The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim" cat="angel	team	club">Angels</a>  may be willing to let Rodriguez go because  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Arredondo" cat="">Jose Arredondo</a>  has shown he could take over the closer's role. Rodriguez is likely to command a five-year deal worth at least $75 million on the  <b>free-agent</b> market. "This has been my family for 10 years. I would love to stay here for many years. I don't know what's going to happen," Rodriguez said. Dissecting the Angels' latest post-season flop would seem to seem to  <b>boil</b> down to one telling number - 43. That's how many runners they stranded in the four games while scoring only 13 runs. It wasn't that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim" cat="angel	team	club">Angels</a>  weren't hitting. Their  <b>hits</b> just weren't producing runs. Rather amazingly, Teixeira and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero" cat="person	player	angel	star">Guerrero</a>  each went 7-for-15 (.467) and provided a  <b>grand total</b> of one  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in" cat="statistics">RBI</a> , by Teixeira. Hunter was the exception in the heart of the order; he went 7-for-18 and drove in five runs. Among the  <b>disappointments</b> at the plate were  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howie_Kendrick" cat="">Howie Kendrick</a>  (2-for-17 with no  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in" cat="statistics">RBIs</a> ) and Anderson (3-for-19 with no  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in" cat="statistics">RBIs</a> ). Then there was the Angels' squeeze that failed in the ninth  <b>inning</b> of the  <b>concluding</b> game  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football" cat="show">Monday night</a> , when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Aybar" cat="player	person	angel">Erick Aybar</a>  missed his  <b>bunt</b> attempt and  <b>catcher</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Varitek" cat="player	winner	person	star	catcher">Jason Varitek</a>  tagged out  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Willits" cat="person	player	outfielder	angel">Reggie Willits</a>  .
