Story published at magicvalley.com on Wednesday, October 08, 2008 Last modified on Wednesday, October 8, 2008 12:32 AM MDT New copper mine planned in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" cat="state	colony">Nevada</a>  By Nate Poppino Times-News  <b>writer</b> A  <b>subsidiary</b> of a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" cat="country	nation	colony	member	state">Canadian</a>  company wants to reopen a long-neglected  <b>copper mine</b> in just a few years, officials confirmed this week. Enexco International plans to branch out from its current site near Contact, Nev., to another site that has not been mined in  <b>nearly</b> a century, said Art Small, Enexco chief  <b>project manager</b> based in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filer,_Idaho" cat="city">Filer</a> . Enexco bought the newer site just six to eight months ago. Both sites represent recent moves by the company to capitalize on higher  <b>copper</b> prices, Small said. The  <b>metal</b> has jumped from 67 cents per  <b>pound</b> to as high as $4, he said, largely driven by development in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" cat="peoples	civilization	region">China</a>  and other  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_supermarket" cat="supermarket">Asian markets</a> . Even though that price is now closer to $2.50 a  <b>pound</b>, the benefits are still worth studying the rocks 15 miles south of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackpot,_Nevada" cat="place	community">Jackpot</a> . "It's never been thoroughly drilled," Small said. The newer mine, 12 miles east of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(novel)" cat="novel">Contact</a>  site, was first claimed in  <b>1880</b>, Small said. But it only produced a  <b>little bit</b> of  <b>copper ore</b>, and certainly much less than  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(novel)" cat="novel">Contact</a>  - which was mined as late as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" cat="war	conflict	1930s	1940s">World War II</a> . Company officials think it holds much more. So they <b>'ve</b> signaled  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau" cat="group">the Bureau</a>  of Land Management that they  <b>want to</b> start drilling in a mix of private and federal land, triggering an  <b>environmental study</b> of the area, said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M._Lindsay" cat="academic	servant	scholar	alumnus	person	relations	educator	writer	scientist">Jim Lindsay</a> , a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management" cat="state	agency">BLM</a>   <b>geologist</b> with the agency's field office in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells,_Nevada" cat="city">Wells</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nev_the_bear" cat="puppet	bear">Nev</a> . Studies will be required for both the exploration and  <b>mining</b> phases of the project, and Small said it could be four or five years before the process is finished. In the meantime, the company can continue work on the private land already cleared with the  <b>state</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" cat="state	colony">Nevada</a> . The site covers about 4,000 acres stretching from Middle Stack Mountain to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana" cat="place	town	crossing">Tijuana</a>  John Peak, Small said. Even though Enexco hasn't filed its official proposal yet - it's expected in a couple of months -  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay,_Ontario" cat="post	community">Lindsay</a>  said the company has been very good about working with him to predict and address any  <b>environmental issues</b>. The goal, he said, is to avoid the need for the company to conduct mitigation later. The company knows there are a "whole host" of environmental problems yet to be resolved, Small said, though not all of them will be known until the  <b>environmental study</b> is done. One thing he doesn't expect to find is  <b>mercury</b>, which he said did not show up when the site was assayed.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho" cat="state">Idaho</a>  environmental groups and others have criticized  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" cat="state	colony">Nevada</a>   <b>mines</b> as contributing to  <b>mercury</b> problems in the northern state, and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" cat="state	colony">Nevada</a>  has recently worked with several  <b>mines</b> to clean them up. Other focuses of the study will include possible effects on  <b>surface water</b> in the area and the nearby  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarbidge_Wilderness" cat="area">Jarbidge Wilderness Area</a> , Lindsay said. Unlike many  <b>copper mines</b>, it looks like  <b>sulfites</b> may not be a problem, he said, meaning the company won't have to deal with  <b>acidic</b>  <b>drainage</b>. "It's  <b>looking</b> like it might be a real reasonable project if they find enough resource there," Lindsay said. Though the mine is in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" cat="state	colony">Nevada</a> , it could be a boon for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Falls,_Idaho" cat="place	seats	city">Twin Falls</a>  area because of the jobs it will create, Small said. The company's current drilling crews largely come from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Falls,_Idaho" cat="place	seats	city">Twin Falls</a> , he said, and as many as 100 people could be employed in the mine - though the company won't have an exact number until it finishes studying the mine. Lindsay agreed, pointing out that mine work pays well and that the worker pool has dried up in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" cat="state	colony">Nevada</a> . "We don't have enough people to cover the jobs we <b>'ve</b> got," he said. Special options are available to registered members. for the member  <b>login page</b> or to register as a member.
