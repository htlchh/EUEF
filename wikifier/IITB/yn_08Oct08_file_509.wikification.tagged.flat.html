Ovechkin skated off the ice at the team's home  <b>arena</b> after less than 15 minutes. "He'll be OK. He'll be playing Friday,"  <b>coach</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Boudreau" cat="person	player	roadrunner	alumnus	pick	coach	personnel	winner">Bruce Boudreau</a>  said at the Capitals' annual media day event. "You know, it's nothing serious at all, but, I mean, it would be prudent for me not to say why he went off." Another Capitals forward,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Semin" cat="pick	player	person	winger">Alexander Semin</a>  , also missed practice time Tuesday - and also is in the team's plans for Game 1. "He should be fine," Boudreau said. "Not feeling well." The team later said both players were dealing with  <b>nagging</b> injuries. Forward  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintin_Laing" cat="player	personnel	winger	person	alumnus	pick">Quintin Laing</a>  , meanwhile, cleared  <b>waivers</b> and was assigned to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League" cat="">AHL</a>  club  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_Bears" cat="bear	team	capital">Hershey</a> . He was one of three players - along with  <b>defenceman</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Alzner" cat="defencemen	person	player	pick	alumnus	personnel">Karl Alzner</a>  and forward  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bourque" cat="player	winger	pick	person	champion">Chris Bourque</a>  - who were cut Monday to set the season-opening roster. "Those were the most difficult cuts we <b>'ve</b> had to make here,"  <b>general manager</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McPhee" cat="manager	sportspeople	person	player	winner	oiler	men">George McPhee</a>  said. "I think it suggests we <b>'ve</b> got a  <b>pretty good</b> team now and we're deep." Discussing those moves publicly for the first time, McPhee said  <b>2007 first-round draft pick</b> Alzner was not demoted because of  <b>salary-cap</b> considerations. "If he was ready to play right now, we <b>'d</b> make room for him. But he needs a little more experience," McPhee said. "It's like taking a kid who's in 11th grade in  <b>high school</b> and putting him right in  <b>college</b>. Why don't we let him go to the  <b>12th grade</b> for a little while and then see if we can put him in  <b>college</b>?"
