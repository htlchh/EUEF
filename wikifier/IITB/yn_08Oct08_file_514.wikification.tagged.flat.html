Ovechkin Ovechkin skated off the ice at the team's home  <b>arena</b> after less than 15 minutes. "He'll be OK. He'll be playing Friday,"  <b>coach</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Boudreau" cat="person	player	roadrunner	alumnus	pick	coach	personnel	winner">Bruce Boudreau</a>  said at the Capitals' annual media day event. "You know, it's nothing serious at all, but, I mean, it would be prudent for me not to say why he went off." Another Capitals forward, , also missed practice time Tuesday -- and also is in the team's plans for Game 1. "He should be fine," Boudreau said. "Not feeling well." The team later said both players were dealing with  <b>nagging</b> injuries. Forward , meanwhile, cleared  <b>waivers</b> and was assigned to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League" cat="">AHL</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_Bears" cat="bear	team	capital">Hershey</a> .

"I think it suggests we <b>'ve</b> got a  <b>pretty good</b> team now and we're deep." Discussing those moves publicly for the first time, McPhee said  <b>2007 first-round draft pick</b> Alzner was not demoted because of  <b>salary-cap</b> considerations. "If he was ready to play right now, we <b>'d</b> make room for him. But he needs a little more experience," McPhee said. "It's like taking a kid who's in 11th grade in  <b>high school</b> and putting him right in  <b>college</b>. Why don't we let him go to the  <b>12th grade</b> for a little while and then see if we can put him in  <b>college</b>?"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" cat="record	economics">Copyright</a>   <b>2008</b> by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" cat="cooperative	agency	establishment	medium	recipient">The Associated Press</a>  More  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlines_(The_Tonight_Show)" cat="">Headlines</a>  Inside  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a>  ESPN.com: | | | | | | | | Â©2008 ESPN Internet Ventures. and are applicable to you.
