The ride, which has raised  <b>thousands</b> of dollars for the Tomorrow's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_(virtue)" cat="">Hope</a>  charity, is scheduled for a Saturday in early October each year and took place this past weekend. Last year, registrants reached the 1,500 participant limit  <b>cap</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_September" cat="album">late September</a>  as late registrants filled remaining spaces. This year the 1,500 participant limit was  <b>reached</b> before the Sept. 15 registration deadline, leaving no room for  <b>procrastinating</b> registrants. Riders hailed mostly from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin" cat="state">Wisconsin</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" cat="state">Illinois</a> . However 44 riders made the trip to Lake Mills from 14 other states. There were 10 riders from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota" cat="state">Minnesota</a> , nine from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_men's_basketball" cat="men">Washington state</a> , eight from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa" cat="state">Iowa</a> , five from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana" cat="state">Indiana</a> , two from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a> , two from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" cat="state">Missouri</a>  and one rider from each from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" cat="state	colony">California</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" cat="state">Colorado</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" cat="state">Hawaii</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho" cat="state">Idaho</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" cat="state">Ohio</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" cat="state">Oregon</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" cat="colony	state">Pennsylvania</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" cat="colony	state">Texas</a> . This year, new routes took riders north and south of Lake Mills, offering five different rest areas. Riders had the option of completing an 18-mile ride, a 26-mile ride, a 46-mile ride or a 66-mile ride. This year, all four rides began at the  <b>brewery</b> and led past a section of the north end of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Lake_(Wisconsin)" cat="">Rock Lake</a>  before splitting off at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Lake_(Wisconsin)" cat="">Rock Lake</a>  Road. The 18-mile ride took riders around  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Lake_(Wisconsin)" cat="">Rock Lake</a> , down  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_(band)" cat="quartet	group">Mud</a>  Lake Road, up  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_Highway_30" cat="highway">Harvey Road</a>  and back into  <b>town</b> via the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drumlin" cat="landforms">Glacial Drumlin</a>  Trail. A majority of the riders  <b>chose</b> to take the two longest routes. Most riders fell into the 31-40, 41-50 and 51-60 age categories. A total of 19 riders were under the age of  <b>21 and</b> three riders were 70 and older.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising" cat="">ADVERTISEMENT</a>  All money collected from registration fees, extra  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt" cat="">T-shirt</a>  sales and extra meal sales are donated to Tomorrow's Hope after expenses for the event are paid. Stacey McGinnis, ride coordinator for Tyranena, said, “Anything that does not go to pay a bill for the event, goes to the  <b>charity</b>. We do not keep any of that money.” In fact, the  <b>brewery</b> absorbs a large part of the expenses in providing staff for the event and coordination of the event itself. More than 1,500  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt" cat="">T-shirts</a>  were ordered for participants, in addition to  <b>418</b>  <b>pounds</b> of  <b>lasagna</b> and 1,114  <b>pounds</b> of  <b>pork</b> for the meal following the ride. Music was provided by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil" cat="deity	angel	demon	loanword">Devil</a>  In A  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_fuel" cat="fuel">Woodpile</a> , Pupy Costello and his Big City  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honky_tonk" cat="">Honky Tonk</a>  and Greg  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Börner" cat="">Boerner</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearly_(band)" cat="group">Nearly</a>  100 volunteers were needed to pull off Saturday's ride. Tomorrow's Hope provides a few volunteers each year and Mick and Tammy  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson,_New_Zealand" cat="region	city">Nelson</a>  of Jefferson, who started up the ride six years ago, along with their crew of volunteers, check in the 1,500 registered riders before the ride begins on Saturday morning. Riders were required to wear both bib numbers and  <b>wrist bands</b> this year, which were distributed at registration. Rider fees were $40, which is where most of the funds raised for Tomorrow's Hope come from. In recent years, unregistered riders have participated in the event, riding the routes and enjoying refreshments, leaving registered riders short on supplies at rest stops and meals at the end of the ride. McGinnis said, “It's important that people don't pirate those fees. Registration fees are what make this event run.” McGinnis noted that one big change in this year's event was the number of online registrations. In  <b>2007</b>, 800 registrations were entered manually, this year only 400 had to be registered by hand. Next year online registrations will be required from all participants.
