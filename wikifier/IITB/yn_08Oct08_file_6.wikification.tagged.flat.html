The meeting, hosted by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia" cat="king	politician	recipient	person	politics	leaders	muslim">Saudi King Abdullah</a> , could still help open the way to dialogue between the Western-backed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan" cat="politics">Afghan government</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">the Taliban</a>  to end fighting that has killed more than 3,800 people already this year, a third of them civilians. "It's totally wrong news. There were no talks and no  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">Taliban</a>  representative was there. It was an ordinary and normal meeting and dinner," Muttawakil told the Pakistan-based  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_Information_Publication" cat="">AIP</a>   <b>news agency</b>. "During our meetings with delegations from different countries, everybody talked about the problems of and expressed concerns and similarly, we came to know  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" cat="country	state	nation">Saudi Arabia</a>  is also concerned," he said. "But neither were there formal negotiations, nor did  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">Taliban</a>  representatives attend those discussions." Muttawakil's comments follow similar  <b>denials</b> from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan" cat="politics">Afghan government</a>  and other former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">Taliban</a>  present at the meeting. But while the former  <b>foreign minister</b>, always regarded as a moderate in the austere  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism" cat="controversy	neologism">Islamist movement</a> , insists he is no longer a member of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">the Taliban</a> , he and others present in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" cat="country	state	nation">Saudi</a>  are believed to have regular contacts with the  <b>insurgents</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan" cat="president">Afghan President</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai" cat="person	president	recipient	survivor	muslim	expatriate	leaders	exile">Hamid Karzai</a>  made a direct appeal for peace to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">Taliban leader</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Omar" cat="person	muslim	politician	fugitive	islamist	leaders">Mullah Mohammad Omar</a>  last week and asked  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" cat="country	state	nation">Saudi Arabia</a>  to help mediate talks, but the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Afghanistan" cat="politics">Afghan government</a>  also denies any talks have yet taken place.

But  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">the Taliban</a>  is by no means a  <b>fully</b> unified group and has allies, such as the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haqqani_network" cat="relations">Haqqani network</a>  operating in eastern  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" cat="country	territory	dispute	republic	state">Afghanistan</a> , that analysts say are reliant on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda" cat="organization	controversy	supraorganizations	establishment">al Qaeda</a>  support. In a possible sign of  <b>de-escalation</b> of the conflict,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">the Taliban</a>  said on Wednesday they would not attack food and aid  <b>convoys</b> as long as they were destined for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" cat="country	territory	dispute	republic	state">Afghan</a>  civilians and the  <b>insurgents</b> were informed in advance. The statement comes two days after the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" cat="nation	system	supraorganizations	establishment	prize">U.N.</a>  special envoy to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" cat="country	territory	dispute	republic	state">Afghanistan</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Eide" cat="diplomat	member	person	politician	secretary">Kai Eide</a> , appealed to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">the Taliban</a>  and its leaders to ensure safe access for  <b>humanitarian</b> programmes, including  <b>food distribution</b> and  <b>polio vaccination</b>. "If we are sure that all food in the  <b>convoy</b> is meant for the common people, we will never attack it,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">Taliban</a>  spokesman  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qari_Mohammad_Yousuf" cat="person">Qari Mohammad Yousuf</a>  told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_Information_Publication" cat="">AIP</a> . "The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" cat="nation	system	supraorganizations	establishment	prize">United Nations</a>  should contact the  <b>mujahideen</b> before sending food supplies to areas controlled by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">Taliban</a>  and not bring  <b>police</b> and other forces along with them and then  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">the Taliban</a>  will not attack them," he said.
