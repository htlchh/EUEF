A new method for making flexible arrays of tiny  <b>silicon</b>  <b>solar cells</b> could produce devices that don't suffer these trade-offs. Arrays of these microcells are as efficient as conventional solar panels and may be cheaper to manufacture because they use significantly less  <b>silicon</b>. The tiny  <b>solar cells</b> could be incorporated into, among other applications, window tinting, and they might be used to power a car's  <b>air conditioner</b> and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS</a> .<br><br>Researchers led by John  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_(c.1505â€“1555)" cat="">Rogers</a> , a  <b>professor</b> of  <b>materials science and engineering</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" cat="">University of Illinois</a>  in Urbana-Champagne, used a combination of  <b>etching</b> and  <b>transfer printing</b> to create arrays of  <b>silicon</b>  <b>cells</b> that are one-tenth the thickness of conventional  <b>cells</b>. They demonstrated multiple possible designs for  <b>solar panels</b> incorporating the microcells, including dense arrays flexible enough to bend around a  <b>pencil</b>. "You could roll them up like a  <b>carpet</b>, transport them in a van, and unfurl them onto a rooftop," Rogers says.<br><br>The process builds on techniques for making  <b>flexible electronics</b> that Rogers has been developing over the past few years. First, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" cat="state">Illinois</a>  researchers etch bars about 1.5  <b>millimeters</b> long, 50  <b>micrometers</b> wide, and 15  <b>micrometers</b> thick from a  <b>wafer</b> of  <b>monocrystalline silicon</b>. They use a  <b>stamp</b> made of a soft  <b>polymer</b> to pick up the microbars and place them on a  <b>substrate</b>, which may be  <b>glass</b> or a  <b>flexible plastic</b>, and then fabricate interconnects. Rogers found that a  <b>cell</b> thickness of 15 to 20  <b>micrometers</b> struck a good balance: thin enough to be flexible, but thick enough to be mechanically  <b>stable</b> and efficient. Conventional  <b>solar cells</b> use a layer of  <b>silicon</b> 150 to 200  <b>micrometers</b> thick.<br><br>Arrays of the  <b>cells</b> have about a 12 percent efficiency.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illinois" cat="building">The Illinois</a>  researchers increased the arrays' power output by about two and half times by adding concentrators in the form of a layer of  <b>cylindrical</b>  <b>microlenses</b>. The best  <b>solar cells</b> on the market convert more than 20 percent of the  <b>sunlight</b> that falls on them into  <b>energy</b>.<br><br>"This is a nice start at using  <b>silicon wafers</b> more efficiently," says Howard Branz, principal  <b>scientist</b> in the  <b>silicon</b> materials and devices group at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" cat="organization	building">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> , in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden,_Colorado" cat="city	seats">Golden, CO</a> . With their  <b>transfer-printing</b> approach, says Branz, Rogers and his group have for the first time demonstrated how such thin  <b>cells</b> could be manufactured on large areas.<br><br>Flexible  <b>solar cells</b> made from another form of  <b>silicon</b>, called  <b>amorphous silicon</b>, have found a place in  <b>niche</b> applications where low weight is critical. However, these  <b>cells</b> haven't come into  <b>wider</b> use because they're much less efficient than the  <b>crystalline silicon</b> used in conventional  <b>solar cells</b>. There are many groups working on new materials, including  <b>polymers</b> for flexible  <b>solar cells</b>. But these materials don't yet match the efficiency and durability of  <b>silicon</b>, says  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Chen" cat="prize winner	person	violinist">Ray Chen</a> , a  <b>professor</b> in the  <b>microelectronics</b>  <b>research center</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin" cat="university	institution">University of Texas at Austin</a> . "I can't say  <b>silicon</b> will be the material in the long term," says Chen. "But based on the data we have at this moment, [monocrystalline] silicon is a very robust material and has the advantage of reliability and efficiency.<br><br>A major advantage of making  <b>solar-cell</b> arrays using his  <b>transfer-printing</b> process, says Rogers, is the ability to control the spacing between the microcells. Sparse arrays of the  <b>cells</b> are semitransparent and could be used as tinted, energy-producing window coatings. Rogers also hopes that the thin  <b>solar cells</b> will replace conventional  <b>solar cells</b> on roofs and in other places where  <b>solar cells</b> are already found. If the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" cat="state">Illinois</a>   <b>technology</b> does prove to be cheaper and easier to transport and install than conventional  <b>cells</b>, it could remove some of the barriers to more widespread use of  <b>solar power</b>.<br><br>Still, questions remain concerning the efficiency of Rogers's  <b>solar cells</b>. To be game  <b>changers</b>, these  <b>cells</b> will  <b>need to</b> have an efficiency closer to 15 percent, says Branz. There are existing methods for increasing the efficiency of  <b>monocrystalline silicon</b>  <b>solar cells</b> to more than 20 percent, says  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Communications" cat="company	communications	owner">Rogers</a> , and these methods could be applied to the microcells as well, although the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" cat="">University of Illinois</a>  researchers have not yet focused on optimizing the material's efficiency.<br><br>
