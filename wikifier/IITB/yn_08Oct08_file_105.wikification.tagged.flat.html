(MyFOX Atlanta) -- The lights are back on at a popular  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwinnett_County,_Georgia" cat="county	establishment">Gwinnett County</a>  park Tuesday night.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper" cat="mineral	elements	conductor	metal">Copper</a>   <b>thieves</b> left hundreds of  <b>soccer players</b> in the dark for days. It's the  <b>county</b>'s fifth  <b>copper theft</b> in the last two months. Police believe at least three of the cases are connected.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwinnett_County,_Georgia" cat="county	establishment">Gwinnett county</a>   <b>police</b> said the damage at all five area fields adds up to at least $70,000. Those who play at the latest park hit are taking it personally.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionable_Content" cat="winner	webcomics">Pintsize</a>  players pass a  <b>soccer ball</b> -  <b>feet</b> away from where an  <b>electrician</b> works - replacing  <b>copper</b> wiring. Police said  <b>thieves</b> yanked hundreds of  <b>pounds</b> of underground wiring from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinckneyville,_Mississippi" cat="community">Pickneyville</a>  Park Thursday. "What they did is came in and clipped everything - and then they pulled the main out," said service  <b>electrician</b> Bob  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Lipps" cat="player	receiver	person">Lipps</a> . The  <b>thieves</b> went from pole to pole -- leaving all five fields without lights. "We had to shorten the practices and have everybody start up at four - and we had to quit about 7:15. We don't want the kids here after dark," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Welch_(writer)" cat="writer	person	poet">James Welch</a>  of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia" cat="city">Norcross</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football" cat="sport	code	game">Soccer</a>  Academy.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia" cat="city">Norcross</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football" cat="sport	code	game">Soccer</a>  Academy players and parents  <b>helped</b> pay for the lights years ago. "It's almost like someone steals something from you personally," said Welch.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper" cat="mineral	elements	conductor	metal">Copper</a>  crooks can get about $3.00 per  <b>pound</b> - a payout electricians say isn't worth the risk. "It can kill you quick. It can kill you real quick," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Lipps" cat="player	receiver	person">Lipps</a> . Electricians wrapped up their work after five days. "They didn't win, we're going to play  <b>soccer</b> and it's going to be lit up," said Welch. Because many of the wires cut and yanked stretched through the fields, electricians believe the  <b>copper</b> crooks used a  <b>truck</b> to yank them from the ground.
