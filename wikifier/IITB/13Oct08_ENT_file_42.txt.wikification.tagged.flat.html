Kline was educated at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University" cat="institution	university">Boston University</a>  and in  <b>1936</b> he enrolled at Heatherley's Art School in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" cat="capital	port	city	place">London</a> . On his return to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">America</a>  in  <b>1939</b> he married Elizabeth Vincent  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons,_Kansas" cat="city">Parsons</a>  - a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_ballet" cat="">British ballet</a>   <b>dancer</b> - whom he had met in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" cat="capital	port	city	place">London</a> .<br><br>Kline's early art consisted of paintings of  <b>cityscapes</b> and landscapes of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> ,  <b>murals</b> and portraits were also part of his early efforts and there was a tinge of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism" cat="">Expressionism</a>  evident in his works. It was during this time in the late 1930s that he acquired two patrons from whom he received  <b>tremendous</b> encouragement and support - Dr. Theodore J. Edlich, Jr. and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Orr" cat="democrat	person	mayor">David Orr</a> . During this period Kline received awards in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Academy" cat="">the National Academy</a>  of Design annuals, but his more mature and representative style developed in the late 1940s after his meeting with other  <b>abstract expressionists</b>;  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Kooning" cat="painter	person	artist	immigrant	citizen">Willem de Kooning</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" cat="artist	person	painter">Jackson Pollock</a> . Kline's style basically consists of bold strokes of  <b>black and white</b> enamel. This  <b>black and white</b> style would be revealed to the world in his first solo exhibition at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" cat="area	capital	settlement	place	establishment	game	city">New York</a> 's Egan Gallery in  <b>1950</b>. Indeed, it was his  <b>black and white</b> paintings he is known famously for, although he also worked on colour paintings since the mid 1950s and colour began appearing more consistently in his paintings after  <b>1959</b>. His first solo exhibition followed soon after and would associate  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kline" cat="person	alumnus	artist	painter">Franz Kline</a>  with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism" cat="movement">Abstract Expressionism</a>  forever.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Kooning" cat="painter	person	artist	immigrant	citizen">Willem de Kooning</a>  was enormously influential in the development of Kline's mature style, and the guiding force behind his transformation from a  <b>painter</b> of  <b>landscapes</b> and realistic themes to  <b>abstraction</b>. The event that led to the transition is an interesting one, Kline took a drawing and gave it to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Kooning" cat="painter	person	artist	immigrant	citizen">de Kooning</a>  who projected it using a Bell  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opticon/Fiction_(Dreams_In_Digital)" cat="song	singles">Opticon</a>  projector, the  <b>projector</b> enlarged the drawing so much that the image began to  <b>overlap</b> at the edges. The impact of this  <b>projection</b> almost instantly transformed Kline from  <b>figurative art</b> to  <b>abstract</b> representation. This incident had occurred at a time when Kline was intellectually exhausted, and provided impulse he needed to progress as an  <b>artist</b>. The transformation was represented through the Nijinsky paintings, which possess elements of  <b>self-portraiture</b> and depicting a series of heads based on the  <b>dancer</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaslav_Nijinsky" cat="expatriate	dancer	person	ballet	parent	vegetarian	burial	diarist">Nijinsky</a>  in the role of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrushka" cat="doll	puppet	character">Petroushka</a> .<br><br>One can't fail to experience a dynamic, spontaneous and dramatic impact on viewing Kline's paintings. The general inspiration of Kline's works range from symbols of the modern  <b>industrial civilization</b> such as  <b>railroads</b>, engines, tunnels, bridges, etc. Though spontaneity is the most recognized characteristic, Kline's many complex renditions are a result of extensive studies. His paintings were created after referring to his own compositional drawings. He would draw sketches first on any paper he could find before he began his masterpieces. His paintings  <b>mask</b> the conscious effort behind them, but the visible spontaneity and intensity of his paintings classified him along with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" cat="artist	person	painter">Jackson Pollock</a>  and other  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism" cat="movement">Abstract Expressionists</a>  under the title  <b>'action painter'</b>.<br><br>Some of Klein's famous paintings after  <b>1950</b> include  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">N.Y</a> . (1953), Painting Number 2 ( <b>1954</b>) and Untitled (1957). Kline died in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  in  <b>1962</b> of a  <b>heart condition</b>, after adding yet another  <b>dimension</b> to the rich  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism" cat="movement">Abstract Expressionism</a>  Movement.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kline" cat="person	alumnus	artist	painter">Franz Kline</a>  and many of the other artists of The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism" cat="movement">Abstract Expressionism</a>  Movement - such as Marc  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko" cat="person	artist	painter	jew	citizen	suicide	immigrant	printmaker">Rothko</a>  - often created artwork with  <b>oil paints</b> on his Artists Canvases<br>
