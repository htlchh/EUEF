    Search 118 hurt when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Thai_Police" cat="">Thai police</a>  fire tear  <b>gas</b> against crowd Updated | Comment | Recommend | | |  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok" cat="capital	place	province">BANGKOK, Thailand</a>  (AP)   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" cat="country">Thai</a>  riot police clashed Tuesday with  <b>thousands</b> of protesters who barricaded  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament" cat="form	legislature	loanword">Parliament</a>  and vowed to block the government from leaving, a bold new tactic that intensified a six-week political crisis. More than 100 people were wounded, including two protesters who had parts of their legs blown off by what  <b>police</b> said were exploding  <b>tear gas</b> canisters. The  <b>violence</b>, which began shortly after 6 a.m. when  <b>police</b> first cleared the street outside  <b>parliament</b>, surged again in late afternoon, as the authorities fired countless volleys of  <b>tear gas</b> to break through the protesters' cordon so lawmakers could leave. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots, though who was firing them could not be determined. Some  <b>police</b> had been armed with  <b>shotguns</b>, and an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" cat="cooperative	agency	establishment	medium	recipient">AP Television News</a>   <b>reporter</b> saw a protester who was carrying a gun. Rioting protesters also set fire to parked cars, trucks and vans. About a  <b>mile</b> away from the fighting, an unidentified person was killed when a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep" cat="motor	company	vehicle	manufacturer	design">Jeep</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle" cat="classification	style">SUV</a>  exploded near the headquarters of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Nation_Party" cat="party">Chart Thai Party</a> , a member of the six-party  <b>coalition government</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" cat="title	minister">Prime Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somchai_Wongsawat" cat="person	lawyer	judges">Somchai Wongsawat</a> . Police said they suspected a  <b>bomb</b> caused the blast, but could provide no other details. Even before the  <b>violence</b> escalated, the  <b>chaos</b> prompted  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister" cat="">Deputy Prime Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavalit_Yongchaiyudh" cat="commander	politician	person">Chavalit Yongchaiyudh</a>  to resign and resulted in new  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" cat="title	minister">Prime Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somchai_Wongsawat" cat="person	lawyer	judges">Somchai Wongsawat</a>  sneaking out of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament" cat="form	legislature	loanword">Parliament</a>  to avoid being spotted by angry protesters demanding his resignation.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest" cat="protest">Protesters</a>  led by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Alliance_for_Democracy" cat="dispute	group">People's Alliance for Democracy</a>  have occupied the grounds of the  <b>prime minister</b>'s office since late August. They expanded their protest overnight by marching to the nearby  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament" cat="form	legislature	loanword">Parliament</a> , and erected barbed  <b>wire</b> and  <b>tire</b> barricades to block Somchai from delivering his first policy speech to lawmakers.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control" cat="">Riot police</a>  moved in after  <b>sunrise</b> and fired multiple rounds of  <b>tear gas</b> canisters to clear a path for the government and lawmakers. Somchai opened the  <b>parliamentary session</b> after a 90-minute delay but as he spoke chaos escalated outside the building.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Burmese_anti-government_protests" cat="politics	dispute	massacre	riot	protest">Anti-government protesters</a>  regrouped and barricaded all four entrances to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament" cat="form	legislature	loanword">Parliament</a> , saying their goal was to block top officials from leaving the building. Police fired more tear  <b>gas</b> canisters to disperse a group of demonstrators armed with wooden  <b>batons</b> and  <b>slingshots</b>, who were throwing  <b>firecrackers</b> at  <b>police</b>. The opposition  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_(Thailand)" cat="party">Democrat Party</a>  boycotted the speech. After the  <b>parliamentary session</b> ended, lawmakers said they were too afraid to leave the building. "We are under  <b>siege</b> now," said Kuthep Saikrajang, a spokesman of the ruling  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Power_Party_(Thailand)" cat="party">People's Power Party</a> , speaking by  <b>mobile phone</b> from inside  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament" cat="form	legislature	loanword">Parliament</a> . "But we will have to figure out a way to get out without using force." Hundreds of lawmakers waited inside the lobby of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament" cat="form	legislature	loanword">Parliament</a> , monitoring the  <b>chaos</b> outside. It was unclear how Somchai left the building, but he arrived by  <b>helicopter</b> later in the day at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Thai_Armed_Forces_Headquarters" cat="">Supreme Command Headquarters</a>  to meet with army chief Gen.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anupong_Paochinda" cat="general	commander	person">Anupong Paochinda</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief" cat="dispute	rank">Supreme Commander</a>  Boonsrang Niempradit. Earlier in the day, spokesman Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd said the army was "concerned" about the  <b>violence</b> against unarmed protesters and that any serious injuries should be investigated. He dismissed speculation of a military intervention to end the unrest in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" cat="country">Thailand</a> , where the military has staged 18  <b>coups</b> since the country became a  <b>constitutional monarchy</b> in  <b>1932</b>. "Victory is near. We are surrounding the building," one of the protest leaders Somsak Kosaisuk told a cheering crowd outside  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament" cat="form	legislature	loanword">Parliament</a> , where protesters had chained one of the gates shut. The unrest was the latest twist in a political crisis that has gripped  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" cat="country">Thailand</a>  for six weeks and virtually  <b>paralyzed</b> the government. The clashes wounded 118 people, including 24 seriously, said Petpong Kumtonkitjakarn of the Erawan  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Center_(TV_series)" cat="winner	ending	show">Medical Center</a> . A few policemen were among those hurt, including one who needed  <b>surgery</b> after being stabbed in the  <b>abdomen</b> with a pole by a protester, said  <b>police</b> Lt. Thirapol Pokpong.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirikit" cat="dame	regent	marshals	alumnus	person">Queen Sirikit</a> , the wife of the country's revered  <b>monarch</b>, donated $2,900 to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok" cat="capital	place	province">Bangkok</a> 's Vachira Hospital to help treat the injured, said  <b>hospital</b> director  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wan_Chai" cat="place">Wanchai</a>  Chareonchoktawee. Reporters outside  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament" cat="form	legislature	loanword">Parliament</a>  heard gunfire when  <b>police</b> moved in after  <b>sunrise</b>, but  <b>police</b> insisted that only  <b>tear gas</b> was being used against the crowd in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok" cat="capital	place	province">Bangkok</a> . "We did not use any  <b>weapon</b> other than  <b>tear gas</b> and shields to clear the path for parliamentarians to go into the building," said deputy  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok" cat="capital	place	province">Bangkok</a>   <b>police chief</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_General" cat="rank">Maj. Gen.</a>  Umnuey Nimmanno. "It is conventional practice in dispersing a crowd. We did not use disproportionate force." Somchai made no immediate comment about the unrest as he stood before lawmakers reading from a prepared policy text, covering issues from the  <b>global financial crisis</b> to global warming, health care and restoring national unity. Somchai was sworn in as prime  <b>minister</b> on Sept. 25 but has been forced to run the government from a  <b>makeshift</b> office at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok" cat="capital	place	province">Bangkok</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Mueang_International_Airport" cat="building	airport">Don Muang airport</a> . The protest alliance says Somchai is a proxy for ex- <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra" cat="politician	director	person	scandal	fugitive	alumnus	chairman	leaders">Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra</a> , who was ousted in  <b>2006</b> by military leaders who accused him of  <b>corruption</b> and who now resides in  <b>exile</b>. Somchai is a brother-in-law of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra" cat="politician	director	person	scandal	fugitive	alumnus	chairman	leaders">Thaksin</a> . When protesters originally took over the grounds of Government House on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_26" cat="days">Aug. 26</a> , their intention was to  <b>oust</b> then-Prime Minister  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samak_Sundaravej" cat="person	politician	chef	recipient	personality">Samak Sundaravej</a>   <b>—</b> whom they also accused of being a  <b>puppet</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra" cat="politician	director	person	scandal	fugitive	alumnus	chairman	leaders">Thaksin</a> . They later said they also opposed his successor, Somchai.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samak_Sundaravej" cat="person	politician	chef	recipient	personality">Samak</a>  was dismissed from office on Sept. 9 by a court decision that found him guilty on a conflict of interest charge. He had accepted pay for hosting  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_TV" cat="">a TV</a>  show while in office. The alliance claims  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" cat="country">Thailand</a> 's rural majority  <b>—</b> who gave strong election victories to the ruling  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Power_Party_(Thailand)" cat="party">People's Power Party</a>   <b>—</b> is too  <b>poorly</b> educated to responsibly choose their representatives and says they are susceptible to  <b>vote buying</b>. The  <b>protest group</b> wants the country to abandon the system of one-man, one-vote, and instead have a  <b>mixed system</b> in which some representatives are chosen by certain professions and  <b>social groups</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavalit_Yongchaiyudh" cat="commander	politician	person">Chavalit</a> , the  <b>deputy prime minister</b> in charge of security, was seen as a key figure in helping the government to resolve the crisis. "What happened was partly my responsibility in failing to resolve the conflict," he said in his  <b>resignation letter</b>, according to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture" cat="dispute">Agriculture</a>  Minister Somsak Prisananantakul.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" cat="record	economics">Copyright</a>   <b>2008</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" cat="cooperative	agency	establishment	medium	recipient">The Associated Press</a> .
