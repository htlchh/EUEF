      |   15 Questions ( )  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Duhatschek" cat="sportswriter	broadcaster	winner	person">ERIC DUHATSCHEK</a>  From Wednesday's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail" cat="newspaper">Globe and Mail</a>  | | October 7, 2008 at 11:47 PM  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone" cat="zone">EDT</a>  Hope usually springs eternal at this time of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a>  season, as 30 teams prepare  with fingers crossed  for what they think will be a fabulous year. That, of course, was how it was in the  <b>old days</b>  or before the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a>  staggered the beginning of the season, with a  <b>soft opening</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" cat="concept">Europe</a>  last weekend featuring four games, followed by a second launch in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" cat="list	region">North America</a> , which begins Thursday on four fronts. So now, while hope may spring eternal in 28 markets, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning" cat="sport	team	club">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> 's new/old coach  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Melrose" cat="player	person	coach	alumnus	defencemen	broadcaster	announcer	personnel	sportspeople">Barry Melrose</a>  is already calling for more  <b>sweat</b> from his skilled players; and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins" cat="team	company	club	penguin">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>  are wondering what the heck is going on with their power play, in the absence of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Gonchar" cat="person	expatriate	player	star	champion	defencemen	medalist	pick">Sergei Gonchar</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marián_Hossa" cat="">Marian Hossa</a> . The lesson: Grim reality can set in awfully fast, even in the early days of October, where 15 burning questions will be  <b>asked and answered</b> between now and next June. 1. Will the so-called "new"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a>  eventually feature more scoring? As always,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ovechkin" cat="player	sportspeople	star	person	winner	pick	captain	winger">Alexander Ovechkin</a>  will be a leading candidate for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_"Rocket"_Richard_Trophy" cat="list">Rocket Richard Trophy</a> . Videos 00:03:34 The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a>  season begins in earnest on Thursday. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings" cat="team	club	wings">Detroit Red Wings</a>  will be working to win back-to-back championships, while newcomer  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Stamkos" cat="sportspeople	personnel	player	alumnus	person	pick">Steven Stamkos</a>  starts his career on the ice with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning" cat="sport	team	club">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> . It sure doesn't look promising. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning" cat="sport	team	club">Lightning</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins" cat="team	company	club	penguin">Penguins</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators" cat="club	senator">Senators</a>  collectively boast some of the best pure scoring talent in the league, with a total of seven players capable of finishing in the top 10. For all that, they produced a total of 17 goals  one in  <b>overtime</b>  for an average of just more than four a game in last weekend's openers in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague" cat="capital	city	site	region	building">Prague</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm" cat="city	capital	seats	place">Stockholm</a> . If teams that boast the  <b>likes</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Crosby" cat="champion	person	player	winner	pick	alumnus	personnel	medalist	star">Sidney Crosby</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dany_Heatley" cat="person	pick	player	men	medalist	star	personnel	winner	alumnus">Dany Heatley</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Lecavalier" cat="quebecers	winner	person	pick	player	champion	personnel	expatriate	star	alumnus">Vincent Lecavalier</a>  can produce only four goals a game, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the league. 2. Then who wins the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_"Rocket"_Richard_Trophy" cat="list">Rocket Richard Trophy</a> ? The Richard annually goes to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a> 's goal-scoring leader, which last year was dynamic Capitals  <b>star</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ovechkin" cat="player	sportspeople	star	person	winner	pick	captain	winger">Alexander Ovechkin</a> . Ovechkin became the league's first 60-goal scorer since  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux" cat="pick	winner	personnel	survivor	quebecers	player	star	person	champion	sportspeople	alumnus	executive	catholic	owner	officer	medalist	immigrant	republican	recipient">Mario Lemieux</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaromír_Jágr" cat="">Jaromir Jagr</a>  did it in  <b>1995-96</b>, and he finished with an impressive 65 goals, 13 ahead of runner-up  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Kovalchuk" cat="player	christian	medalist	captain	person	pick	star	winger	winner">Ilya Kovalchuk</a>  of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Thrashers" cat="club	team	sport">Thrashers</a> . Sadly, that kind of dynamic performance has been the exception, not the rule, in the postlockout era, which has had only 10 50-goal seasons in three years. 3. Is there any reason to watch  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Thrashers" cat="club	team	sport">Atlanta</a> , other than  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowalchuk" cat="">Kovalchuk</a> ? Unlikely.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowalchuk" cat="">Kovalchuk</a>  is the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a> 's goal-scoring leader since he broke into the league in 2001-02, with 254 (two more than  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary" cat="place	post	city">Calgary</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarome_Iginla" cat="player	person	alumnus	winner	star	christian	personnel	captain	pick	medalist">Jarome Iginla</a> ). The next two on the list,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marián_Hossa" cat="">Marian Hossa</a>  (223) and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dany_Heatley" cat="person	pick	player	men	medalist	star	personnel	winner	alumnus">Dany Heatley</a>  (221), both played extensively in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia" cat="">Atlanta</a>  as well, suggesting a lot of pretty goals have been scored these past half-dozen years in one of the league's more anonymous markets. 4. But now the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Thrashers" cat="club	team	sport">Thrashers</a>  have ex-Leaf John Anderson behind the bench. Shouldn't that make a difference? Maybe. Anderson is part of a new coaching wave that swept through the league on the  <b>heels</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Boudreau" cat="person	player	roadrunner	alumnus	pick	coach	personnel	winner">Bruce Boudreau</a> 's success in Washington. Suddenly, a lot of teams figured that instead of recycling the same old  <b>faces and names</b> behind the bench, maybe it was time to give someone fresh a look. 5. But  <b>rookie</b> coaches don't often win the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup" cat="establishment	tournament">Stanley Cup</a> , do they? No, it's rare. For every  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Perron" cat="coach	quebecers	champion	person">Jean Perron</a>  who comes along ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal" cat="place	community	establishment	settlement	post	city	capital">Montreal</a> , 1986), there is the inevitable adjustment period for most of the others. Nine of the 30 teams enter the season with a new  <b>coach</b> behind the bench, but realistically, only two have a legitimate chance to win it all. 6. And they are?  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa" cat="place	community	district	capital">Ottawa</a> , with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Hartsburg" cat="person	coach	star	personnel	pick	duck	alumnus	defencemen	player">Craig Hartsburg</a> , and San Jose, with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_McLellan" cat="person	coach	player	alumnus	personnel	champion">Todd McLellan</a> . Hartsburg previously coached in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California" cat="city	place">Anaheim</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" cat="place	settlement	community	city	seats">Chicago</a> , but spent the past five years honing his craft in Sault Ste. Marie. McLellan was an assistant on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Babcock" cat="coach	person	player	duck	champion">Mike Babcock</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_structure_of_the_NHL" cat="season">Stanley Cup-championship</a>  team in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings" cat="team	club	wings">Detroit</a> , but spent 11 years apprenticing in junior ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Current,_Saskatchewan" cat="">Swift Current</a> ) and minor pro ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio" cat="">Cleveland</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston,_Texas" cat="">Houston</a> ). Unlike John Anderson or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_DeBoer" cat="coach	pick	personnel	alumnus	person	admiral">Peter DeBoer</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a> , who <b>'ve</b> inherited  <b>reclamation</b> projects that will take a while to turn around, McLellan gets last year's No. 2 regular-season finisher that was significantly upgraded on defence. 7. Does that make the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharks_(Super_rugby_franchise)" cat="team">Sharks</a>  a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup" cat="establishment	tournament">Stanley Cup</a>  contender? They are every season. One of these years, they may actually do it. By adding  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Blake" cat="star	player	defencemen	pick	person	medalist	men	winner	alumnus	personnel	champion">Rob Blake</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Boyle" cat="">Dan Boyle</a>  on defence, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharks_(Super_rugby_franchise)" cat="team">Sharks</a>  accomplished two things. One, they vastly bumped up their  <b>payroll</b> (and were one of three teams that needed to get under the  <b>salary cap</b> in the  <b>final 24</b> hours before today's 3 p.m.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone" cat="zone">EDT</a>  deadline to submit their opening-night rosters); and two, they addressed their one perceived weakness, experience on the blueline.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLellan_Stores" cat="store	company">McLellan</a> 's former team will pose a significant challenge, but the Sharks, on paper, have few holes. 8. Who else falls into the category?  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_West" cat="album">In the West</a> , both the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim_Ducks" cat="team	duck	club	sport">Ducks</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars" cat="club	team">Dallas Stars</a>  should  <b>contend</b> with the lineups they have. The conference is so strong that there may be another arm's race there at the  <b>trade deadline</b> as the teams  <b>jockey</b> to match each other strength for strength. The East is more balanced, meaning that any number of squads could  <b>contend</b>. The gap between No. 1 ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal" cat="place	community	establishment	settlement	post	city	capital">Montreal</a> ) and No. 10 (Buffalo) was small  only 14 points, or seven wins, or about one victory a month. Presumably, it'll be a  <b>logjam</b> again. 9. It sounds as if goaltenders will be in the spotlight again? Nothing illustrates that better than the Devils'  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Brodeur" cat="player	winner	personnel	star	person	pick	champion	quebecers	medalist	alumnus	citizen	immigrant">Martin Brodeur</a> , who enters the season just 13 victories behind  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Roy" cat="person	player	champion	pick	winner	star	alumnus	sportspeople	personnel">Patrick Roy</a>  on the all-time wins list. Brodeur's full-time  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a>  career began in the  <b>1993-94 season</b>. He didn't win his first Výzina Trophy until  <b>2003</b>, but he's won four of the past five since then. He has led the league in victories eight times and if he maintains his 40-wins-a-season pace, he should slip past Roy in early December. 10. And we'll be seeing more of Roy this season as well? Yes. As part of the Canadiens' centennial celebrations, Roy will have his No.33 retired by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a>  team that he left under a  <b>cloud</b> of controversy in  <b>1995</b>, demanding the trade that eventually landed him in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" cat="state">Colorado</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal" cat="place	community	establishment	settlement	post	city	capital">Montreal</a>  will be the focal point for the entire season  the  <b>all-star game</b>,  <b>draft</b> and, given that they were the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)" cat="division">Eastern Conference</a>  regular-season champions last season, high  <b>hopes</b> for many, many playoff dates. 11. Is this the start of an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Six" cat="wings	team	ranger">Original Six</a>  resurgence? Yes, with the exception of those beleaguered  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs" cat="club">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens" cat="event	team	club">Montreal</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings" cat="team	club	wings">Detroit</a> , two of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Six" cat="wings	team	ranger">the Original Six</a> , were conference champions, and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers" cat="team	ranger	club	subsidiary">Rangers</a>  were a respectable 97-point team. Revivals in both  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts" cat="">Boston</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" cat="place	settlement	community	city	seats">Chicago</a>  seem possible as well. 12. Really,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts" cat="">Boston</a> ? Consider that under coach  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Julien_(ice_hockey)" cat="player	coach	alumnus	winner	person	defencemen	personnel">Claude Julien</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins" cat="club	sport	team">Bruins</a>  made the  <b>playoffs</b> with 94 points, despite losing their best all-round centre,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Bergeron" cat="person	personnel	alumnus	player	medalist	pick">Patrice Bergeron</a> , for all but 10 games; their nominal  <b>starter</b> in goal,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Fernandez" cat="">Manny Fernandez</a> , for all but four; and having just three players appear in all 82 games. If the injury  <b>jinx</b> ends and the development of their youngsters continues, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins" cat="club	sport	team">Bruins</a>  could be a  <b>dark-horse</b> contender for the conference title. 13. And  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" cat="place	settlement	community	city	seats">Chicago</a> ?  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackhawk_(DC_Comics)" cat="">The Blackhawks</a>  will play host to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_NHL_Winter_Classic" cat="sport	wings">Winter Classic</a>   <b>2009</b>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1" cat="days">Jan. 1</a>  on frozen  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field" cat="parks	attraction	venue	establishment	stadium">Wrigley Field</a>   which will put their emerging  <b>young team</b> in the spotlight against divisional rivals  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit,_Michigan" cat="">Detroit</a> . After a decade of missteps and poor decision-making,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" cat="place	settlement	community	city	seats">Chicago</a>  finally got a lot of things right under GM  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Tallon" cat="player	pick	broadcaster	person	alumnus	personnel	star	defencemen	manager">Dale Tallon</a>  and new owner  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Wirtz" cat="alumnus	person	executive	owner	champion">Rocky Wirtz</a> . It'll be up to  <b>coach</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Savard" cat="player	alumnus	champion	person	pick	star	coach">Denis Savard</a>  and that young  <b>nucleus</b> to keep the ship on the right track. 14. Is there one under-the-radar squad that could surprise? Yes,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres" cat="attraction	sport	team">the Buffalo Sabres</a> , who went from 113 points and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents'_Trophy" cat="list">President's Trophy</a>  as regular-season  <b>champs</b> one season to 90 points and out of the  <b>playoffs</b> the next. The Sabres'  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Ruff" cat="personnel	alumnus	person	player	gull	winner	coach	pick	captain">Lindy Ruff</a>  is the longest-tenured  <b>coach</b> in the league, entering his 11th season, and after losing Daniel Briýre and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Drury" cat="pick	player	captain	person	winner	medalist	men	champion">Chris Drury</a>  as  <b>free agents</b> in the summer of  <b>2007</b>, has his new  <b>nucleus</b>  goalie  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Miller_(ice_hockey)" cat="">Ryan Miller</a>  and forwards  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Pominville" cat="person	captain	player	personnel	pick	alumnus">Jason Pominville</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Vanek" cat="men	pick	person	player">Tomas Vanek</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Roy" cat="personnel	person	winner	pick	player	alumnus">Derek Roy</a>   under contract.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club" cat="club	team	list">The Sabres</a>  could be in line for a big  <b>bounce-back</b> season. 15. But when all is  <b>said and done</b>, can anyone really dethrone  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit,_Michigan" cat="">Detroit</a> ? In theory, no. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings" cat="team	club	wings">Red Wings</a>  were the class of the league last season. Their 30-8-3 was the best first-half record in history; they exceeded 100 points for the eighth consecutive season, tying the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens" cat="event	team	club">Canadiens</a>  of 1974-82, as the only other team ever to do so. They won their division for the seventh year in a row; and made the  <b>playoffs</b> for a 17th consecutive season, the longest active streak in  <b>pro sport</b>. Oh, and they added  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marián_Hossa" cat="">Marian Hossa</a> , the premier  <b>free-agent</b> forward, to a star-studded lineup. On paper, they represent the class of the league. They are also savvy enough to know that championships are won on the ice, and this year, with a slightly later start to the season,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup" cat="establishment	tournament">the Stanley Cup final</a>  could go as late as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_15" cat="days">June 15</a> . Only then will all the  <b>real answers</b> finally be in.
