"They have a good-looking  <b>fullback</b> and a speedy  <b>halfback</b>," Serpas said. "They're going to try to get the edge on us and run right at us. We have to contain them.

"The first one I didn't want  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutchtown,_Missouri" cat="village">Dutchtown</a> .
