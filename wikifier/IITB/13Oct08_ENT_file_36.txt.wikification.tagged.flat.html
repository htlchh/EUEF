Die Hard  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_criticism" cat="">Movie Review</a> <br>By Alex Demattia  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_sales_certification" cat="award">Platinum</a>  Quality Author<br><br><br>Like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_Weapon" cat="portrayal	film">Lethal Weapon</a>  the year before,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard" cat="film	novel">Die Hard</a>  is one of the seminal  <b>action films</b> of the 1980's if not ever. It  <b>helped</b> establish a type of  <b>action film</b> that was mimicked several times in  <b>subsequent</b> years, but those inferior imitations don't detract from this spectacular original  <b>film</b> which sees a street-wise, smart ass police man in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McClane" cat="marines	vigilante	lieutenant	detective	murderer	person	character">John McClane</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Willis" cat="actor	person	winner	alumnus	blogger	brat">Bruce Willis</a> ) declare a one-man war against a group of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe" cat="region">East European</a>   <b>terrorists</b> headed by the ruthless  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard" cat="film	novel">Hans Gruber</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rickman" cat="member	actor	director	person	winner">Alan Rickman</a> ) as they break in to the Nakatomi Corporation's  <b>high rise</b> headquarters to steal their money, valuables and priceless  <b>collectibles</b> from their  <b>lockdown</b>  <b>vault</b>. Director  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McTiernan" cat="person	director	alumnus">John McTiernan</a>  is a great  <b>action director</b>, providing several sequences of thrills, establishes a number of conventions that have now become  <b>cliches</b> in the  <b>action genre</b>, and even embeds  <b>suspense</b> and tension as McClane and Gruber engage in a bloody  <b>chess</b> game through the various floors of the  <b>high-rise</b> tower.<br><br>The movie starts off relatively quickly, only taking about ten to fifteen minutes to introduce McClane, his wife, the workers at the Nakatomi  <b>corporation</b>, and the villains before Hans and his team get to work taking over the building. Right from the start there is a professional aura to the  <b>terrorist group</b> who clearly believe they are so smart and have covered all bases that the thought of a smart-ass cop actually dismantling their operation piece by piece is the furthest from their mind.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film" cat="film	genre">Action films</a>  from the 80's didn't pull any punches and Hans is shown to be the brutal man that he is when he guns down the head of the Nakatomi  <b>corporation</b> when he refuses to hand over the code to the  <b>lockdown</b>  <b>vault</b>. Blood is spilt and this  <b>film</b> has no problem with showing it to you. However, there is a certain  <b>cartoon</b> quality to it all; the  <b>violence</b> seems a little detached and desensitised which makes it quite watchable, especially when McClane starts doing it to the bad guys.<br><br>Where this  <b>film</b> is quite innovative is introducing a running by-play between McClane and Hans. This culminates in a  <b>particularly</b>  <b>tense</b> scene where the two men meet face to face for the first time, but McClane doesn't realise he's talking to Hans as Hans pretends to be someone else. At one point, McClane gives Hans a gun to protect himself and in the audience you're screaming, "No!" But as it turns out, McClane was on to him the whole time by not loading the gun. They also have some great lines between them, mostly spoken over  <b>two-way radios</b>. McClane also dispatches of each of Hans' team in style, and given the ruthless nature of each of the bad guys there's a certain guilty pleasure in watching McClane knock each one off in a unique way each time.<br><br>McClane's fight is made all the more entertaining when it becomes clear that he's the only one who can  <b>brings</b> the  <b>terrorists</b> down. This idea is enforced by the inept  <b>policeman</b> trying to gain control of the situation on the ground outside but failing miserably. Only Sgt Al Powell ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_VelJohnson" cat="parameter	person	actor	alumnus">Reginald Vel Johnson</a> ) is of any use to McClane who effectively is not  <b>helped</b> by LA policemen who don't have any good plans, and later two  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" cat="agency	establishment">FBI</a>  agents who run things by the book but it all goes to  <b>hell</b> as Hans and his team have also read the book and have a severe  <b>counterattack</b> planned for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" cat="agency	establishment">the FBI</a>  when they try to take him down.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Willis" cat="actor	person	winner	alumnus	blogger	brat">Bruce Willis</a>  is perfect for the role of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McClane" cat="marines	vigilante	lieutenant	detective	murderer	person	character">John McClane</a> . He achieves that nice balance of being your everyday Joe who can transform in to  <b>action man</b> at the drop of the  <b>hat</b>. He also carries with him a lot of arrogant charm that he uses to great effect when dealing with the bad guys.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rickman" cat="member	actor	director	person	winner">Alan Rickman</a>  does a spectacular turn as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard" cat="film	novel">Hans Gruber</a> ; the cold, calculating nature of the man is perfectly rendered in Rickman's performance although we do enjoy seeing his frustration as McClane keeps at him.<br><br>" <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard" cat="film	novel">Die Hard</a> " is one of the best action films ever made.<br>
