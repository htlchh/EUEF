Representatives of 35  <b>international oil companies</b> will meet with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Iraq" cat="politics">Iraqi government</a>  officials in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" cat="capital	port	city	place">London</a>  on Monday to discuss the bidding process for eight  <b>enormous</b>  <b>oil</b> and  <b>gas</b> fields . If the contracts are approved, they could lead to the biggest foreign stake in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  since the industry was  <b>nationalized</b> more than 30 years ago. About 4,000 miles from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad" cat="capital	community	place	establishment">Baghdad</a> ,  <b>oil companies</b> are doing  <b>damage control</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>   arguably the most dangerous place in the world where firms like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell" cat="company	dispute	brand	contractor">Royal Dutch Shell PLC</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil" cat="scandal	company	contractor	brand">Exxon Mobil Corp</a>  . currently operate. Three years of attacks in the country's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta" cat="disaster	accident	ecoregions	landforms">Niger Delta</a>  have cut  <b>oil</b> production from  <b>2.5</b> million  <b>barrels</b> per day to around 1.5 million  demoting  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" cat="">Africa</a> 's second largest  <b>oil</b>  <b>producer</b> behind  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola" cat="country	state	colony">Angola</a> . The  <b>violence</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  pales next to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> , even now. "The differential is enormous in terms of the physical threat of being killed by a militant," said Ian Pilcher, a  <b>private security</b> consultant who has advised  <b>oil companies</b> in both  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> . " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigerian</a>  hostages are rarely harmed, if at all, and I can't really see  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people" cat="group">West Africans</a>  ever setting up roadside bombs." The risk of death while pursuing  <b>oil</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> , however, comes with the potential for rich rewards. Current estimates put  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> 's  <b>proven oil reserves</b> at 115 billion  <b>barrels</b>  more than three times the 36 billion  <b>barrels</b> held by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a> . Experts believe  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> 's proven reserves could rise by an additional 70 billion to 80 billion  <b>barrels</b> once security conditions stabilize enough to  <b>allow</b> renewed exploration. That would give  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  the world's second-largest  <b>proven oil reserves</b> after  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" cat="country	state	nation">Saudi Arabia</a>  . "Even if the security situation is a problem, the potential is so great that if you are a major  <b>oil</b> company, you have to have an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  strategy in your portfolio," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_(film)" cat="film">Leila</a>  Benali, director of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" cat="">Middle East</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" cat="">Africa</a>   <b>department</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Energy_Research_Associates" cat="establishment	company">Cambridge Energy Research Associates</a>  . And  <b>oil companies</b> are maneuvering to gain access. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Iraq" cat="politics">Iraqi government</a>  recently signed a $3 billion deal with the  <b>state-owned</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Petroleum_Corporation" cat="company	enterprise">China National Petroleum Corp.</a>  to develop the Ahdab  <b>oil field</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Iraq" cat="">southern Iraq</a> . In September,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell" cat="company	dispute	brand	contractor">Shell</a>  signed a deal to establish a  <b>joint venture</b> with the state-run  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraqi</a>  South Oil Co. to tap  <b>natural gas</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Iraq" cat="">southern Iraq</a>  and is expected to spend $3 billion to $4 billion over five years on the project. That deal was announced three days after  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigerian</a>  militants attacked a  <b>pipeline</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta" cat="disaster	accident	ecoregions	landforms">Niger Delta</a>   part of a stepped-up "oil war" the fighters waged for a week before agreeing to a fragile  <b>cease-fire</b>. Militants in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta" cat="disaster	accident	ecoregions	landforms">Niger Delta</a>  have repeatedly bombed  <b>oil pipelines</b> and kidnapped hundreds of  <b>oil</b> workers in an attempt to force the  <b>central government</b> to allocate more  <b>oil</b> revenue to the  <b>southern states</b> where the  <b>petroleum</b> is pumped. They have also set up a  <b>vast</b>  <b>smuggling</b> network to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of  <b>oil</b> stolen from  <b>pipelines</b>  often with help from corrupt security officials and local politicians. That same scenario in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  is not farfetched. "Oil companies can negotiate with the  <b>central government</b>, but if the  <b>local government</b> and local people are not happy, the  <b>oil companies</b> are not going to be able to do what they  <b>want to</b> do," said Amy Jaffe, an  <b>energy</b> expert at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University" cat="institution	university">Rice University</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baker_Institute" cat="">James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy</a> . The situation may be even more  <b>combustible</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  because most of the country's  <b>oil</b> is located in the predominantly  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people" cat="group	community	person	section">Kurdish</a>  north and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam" cat="dispute">Shiite</a>  south  leaving  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam" cat="">Sunnis</a>  at the mercy of the  <b>central government</b> to distribute the nation's resource wealth.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraqi</a>  lawmakers have been deadlocked over a national  <b>oil</b>  <b>law</b> to do just that. "When you have a country with  <b>private militias</b> and you have resource wealth, it is much harder to manage," said Jaffe. "You are always going to have someone who is disgruntled, and they are armed."  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_petroleum_companies" cat="company">Oil companies</a>  must also be careful when trying to quell  <b>violence</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_defender" cat="right">Human rights activists</a>  have accused  <b>oil companies</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  of attempting to buy off the militants, only to  <b>exacerbate</b> the  <b>violence</b> as rival groups fight for the payments that allow them to purchase more weapons. "If you hope the  <b>violence</b> is going to go away or try to buy off the militants or are seen as hopping further into bed with the government ... you are going to make it a lot worse," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Watts" cat="geographer	person">Michael Watts</a> , a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  expert at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" cat="institution	university	landmark	protest">University of California-Berkeley</a>  .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts,_Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Watts</a>  said the  <b>oil companies</b> would be better served to begin with a proactive  <b>community development</b> program  something the firms failed to do in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  until it was too late. But he and others acknowledge that even these programs have risks. Some perceive that the  <b>oil</b> company programs in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  benefit local chiefs and people with connections, which breeds further resentment. Companies also risk taking on responsibilities that rightfully belong to local governments , ensnaring international  <b>corporations</b> in  <b>foreign affairs</b>. The potential for an effective  <b>central government</b> is one area where some see a positive difference between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a> . "In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> , you still have the seeds of a potentially strong  <b>central government</b> if things go well, which you don't really have in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a> ," said Benali. "The problems in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta" cat="disaster	accident	ecoregions	landforms">Niger Delta</a>  are not really under the control of the  <b>central government</b>."  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  also has a better chance of establishing a security  <b>infrastructure</b> that is able to protect  <b>oil companies</b> and facilities  including  <b>private security firms</b> and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_security_forces" cat="">Iraqi military</a> . In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a> , companies are required to use the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_Nigeria" cat="">Nigerian military</a>  or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigerian</a>  security firms. Both groups are seen as corrupt and often complicit in the  <b>violence</b>. "This is where  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  is probably ahead of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  because over the last couple of years  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iraqis" cat="party">the Iraqis</a>  have made a conscious effort to capacity build security forces in a highly proactive way by engaging with Western militaries or Western military companies to give them  <b>first-world</b> training," said Pilcher.
