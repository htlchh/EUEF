And, one of the best ways to evaluate a company is to glance at its  <b>balance sheet</b> to see what it owns with what it owes. The  <b>balance sheet</b> is a paragon of simplicity and is made up of three components: assets (the stuff it owns),  <b>liabilities</b> (the money it owes), and shareholders' equity (the company's value to its  <b>shareholders</b>). Assets take two forms: short-term (or current) assets and long-term assets. Under short-term, there¿s good ol' hard cash. Then, there¿s something called "cash equivalents," which are assets like short-term  <b>bonds</b> that can be sold so quickly, they might as well be cash. There you factor in  <b>inventory</b>, which (if you're a reasonably competent business owner) you can sell to customers in return for--you guessed it--cash. (The  <b>raw materials</b> a company owns to make that  <b>inventory</b> also falls under this category.)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_asset" cat="">Long-term assets</a>  are things that are harder to convert into cash. (Think real estate and equipment.)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_asset" cat="">Long-term assets</a>  depreciate, meaning they lose some value over time. Also under the long-term category are what's called intangible assets: things like  <b>patents</b> and brands, that are important, but hard to quantify. Accountants earn their stripes figuring out the real overall value of these assets. Once you know your assets, it's time for  <b>liabilities</b>. As with assets,  <b>liabilities</b> are separated into short-term or current, and long-term.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_liability" cat="principle">Current liabilities</a>  are what a company owes in that year: Things like payments to employees or accounts payable to suppliers.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_liabilities" cat="principle">Long-term liabilities</a>  are debts paid over several years. Shareholders' equity is determined by subtracting the  <b>liabilities</b> from the assets. That number represents the value of the company after all its bills are paid. Obviously, investors should pay close attention to balance sheets. Spikes in the amount of  <b>debt</b> carried, or a reduction in shareholders' equity, are usually red flags. / / / Energy Tuesday, October 07, 2008 Norsk Hydro Submits Report On  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya" cat="state	country">Libya</a>  To Prosecutors | |  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch" cat="company">MarketWatch</a>  Pulse  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_postal_district" cat="list">LONDON</a>  --  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsk_Hydro" cat="company">Norsk Hydro</a>  said investigators submitted a report into former  <b>oil</b> operations in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya" cat="state	country">Libya</a>  to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" cat="state	country	member">Norwegian</a>  National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_crime" cat="issue">Environmental Crime</a>  and to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  authorities.
