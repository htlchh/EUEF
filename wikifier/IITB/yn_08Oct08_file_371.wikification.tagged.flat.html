    Search scope: Only bidder but coast denied life saving titles  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" cat="network	subsidiary	company">ABC</a>  - October 8, 2008, 2:46 pm  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_(band)" cat="winner	group">The New South</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales" cat="subdivision	region">Wales</a>  central coast has lost its bid to host the National  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_lifesaving" cat="occupation">Surf Life Saving</a>  Titles, despite being the only region interested in holding the event. The  <b>sport</b>'s  <b>peak body</b> has now signed an agreement with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Queensland" cat="">Queensland Government</a>  that will see the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast,_Queensland" cat="resort	city">Gold Coast</a>  host the event for the three years from  <b>2010</b>, and then in two year blocks alternating with other venues around the country.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_lifesaving" cat="occupation">Surf Life Saving</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_(New_South_Wales)" cat="establishment	region	place">Central Coast</a>  says it has been  <b>told</b> the decision was made because of local technical issues. But the group's president,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Myers" cat="coach	person">Jim Myers</a> , says it is very  <b>disappointing</b>. "The perception is that it's a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland" cat="state	colony">Queensland</a>  decision, whether that's true or not," he said. "Perception is that it was always going to be [in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland" cat="state	colony">Queensland</a> ] and we were just used as a tool to get some favour with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast,_Queensland" cat="resort	city">Gold Coast</a> ." The Swansea-Belmont  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Club" cat="">Surf Life Saving Club</a>  says tough financial requirements forced it to pull out of the race to host the championships. After staging successful  <b>state</b> titles at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmiths,_New_South_Wales" cat="place">Blacksmiths Beach</a> , the club was hoping to host the national event but was unable to get  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_New_South_Wales" cat="">NSW Government</a>  funding. Club president Geoff Mabray says the tender process required the club to have almost $2 million cash up-front and $700,000 of in-kind donations from the  <b>local council</b>. "It's a lot to ask of a club like ours, we couldn't afford that," he said. "We had the tender papers all set up and we were going through it all, but we didn't have the backing for the $1.8 million. "We just sent a letter of intent in saying we are interested, but we can't fulfil the tender." He says clubs would have to go to the State Government to secure that kind of money. "At the time the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government" cat="">State Government</a>  had lots of money problems of their own."
