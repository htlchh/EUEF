The Care of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" cat="disease">Rheumatoid Arthritis</a> <br><br>The various forms of  <b>arthritis</b> are each painful and debilitating. Although  <b>arthritis</b> is often attributed to aging, certain types of it can occur at any age. Since this  <b>disease</b> attacks the  <b>joints</b> of the body, the  <b>agility</b> and mobility of the patient is threatened. The  <b>pain</b> becomes difficult to manage, and, as it progesses, it can have a major impact on quality of life and even extend so far as to cause physical  <b>deformity</b>.<br><br>The type of  <b>arthritis</b> known as  <b>rheumatoid arthritis</b> is a  <b>disease</b> of the  <b>immune system</b>. It most often affects the hands of the patient.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" cat="disease">Rheumatoid arthritis</a>  causes severe  <b>inflammation</b> of the  <b>joints</b>, leading to great  <b>pain</b>. In addition to experiencing great  <b>pain</b>, sufferers of this type of  <b>arthritis</b> often exhibit  <b>deformity</b> of the hands and fingers. The patient will lose normal manual function, since the  <b>disease</b> affects both hands at the same time.<br><br>In a more generic sense,  <b>arthritis</b> simply refers to  <b>inflammation</b> of the  <b>joints</b>. In the case of  <b>rheumatoid arthritis</b>, the linings of these  <b>joints</b> become inflamed, which causes  <b>cartilage</b> to be destroyed when the linings become  <b>overgrown</b>, ultimately eroding the  <b>joints</b>. It is this very characteristic that causes the crippling  <b>deformities</b> to the fingers and hands.<br><br>Though  <b>vast</b> numbers of people suffer from all types of  <b>arthritis</b>, those people diagnosed with  <b>rheumatoid arthritis</b> comprise only 1% of the  <b>population</b>. This terrible  <b>disease</b> affects women much more  <b>frequently</b> than men and there is, so far, no known cure for  <b>rheumatoid arthritis</b>. The only treatment at this point is managing the  <b>pain</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery" cat="obstetrics">Doctors</a>  can prescribe various  <b>pain relief</b> remedies, depending upon the patient's  <b>medical history</b>, overall profile and other related factors.<br><br>One of the most common treatments is  <b>oral medications</b> to control the  <b>swelling</b> and thereby reduce the  <b>pain</b> associated with  <b>rheumatoid arthritis</b>. Braces or  <b>splints</b> may be prescribed to provide support to weakened  <b>joints</b> and to remove the excess pressure. If none of these treatments provide relief,  <b>surgery</b> may be performed, especially in the more serious cases. This will reduce  <b>pain</b> and  <b>swelling</b> and improve mobility. The three types of  <b>surgery</b> commonly used are T  <b>synovectomy</b>, osteomoty or  <b>joint replacement</b>.<br><br>When diagnosed early enough, there are many steps that can be used to reduce  <b>pain</b> and the other consequences of this type of  <b>arthritis</b>. So, even though there~s no known cure, if one experiences  <b>pain</b>, swelling, or diminished use of the hands, one should contact a  <b>doctor</b> immediately. A plan can be outlined to reduce  <b>pain</b>, and prepare for future  <b>surgery</b>.<br><br>No-one should have to live with  <b>pain</b> of  <b>arthritis</b>, now that so much progress has been made in the field of  <b>pain management</b>. The first steps in managing the  <b>pain</b> may be as simple as common  <b>aspirin</b> or other medications. If they do not work, a  <b>doctor</b> will then prescribe  <b>medication</b> that specifically targets  <b>arthritis</b>  <b>pain</b>. But before that can happen,there has to be open  <b>communication</b> between the  <b>doctor</b> and the patient regarding the pain early in the treatment. So, it is not advisable to suffer quietly in this case.<br>
