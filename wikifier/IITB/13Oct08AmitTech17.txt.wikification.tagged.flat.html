So far, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration" cat="">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>  has approved a few  <b>vaccines</b> that may be able to  <b>fend</b> off the  <b>virus</b>, but all of those are grown in  <b>chicken eggs</b>, take up to six months to produce, and are each effective against only one strain of the  <b>virus</b>. A  <b>brand-new</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccination" cat="">DNA vaccine</a> , which scientists hope to soon test in humans, may provide much broader protection.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza" cat="disease">Avian influenza</a> , caused by a variant of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1" cat="disease">H5N1 virus</a> , has afflicted hundreds of millions of  <b>birds</b> worldwide. The  <b>virus</b> mutates quickly: some of the  <b>mutations</b>, upon making the jump to humans, have proved fatal. So far,  <b>bird flu</b> has killed at least 250 people.<br><br>"Everyone fears that the  <b>virus</b> only needs to make a few  <b>mutations</b> to become  <b>virulent</b> and transmissible human to human, so this is certainly one of the biggest  <b>pandemic</b> threats that we face," says  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ho_(artist)" cat="artist	alumnus	person">David Ho</a> , a  <b>professor</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_University" cat="university	institution">Rockefeller University</a>  and the scientific  <b>director</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Diamond_AIDS_Research_Center" cat="">Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center</a> , in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> . "It obviously continues to be a threat, even though it's no longer on everyone's  <b>radar</b> screen."<br><br>The  <b>bird flu</b>'s rapid  <b>mutations</b> are precisely what make the  <b>virus</b> so difficult to fight. The few  <b>vaccines</b> that are currently approved to treat it were created using existing  <b>viruses</b>, and therefore, each immunizes against only a single  <b>virulent</b>  <b>mutation</b>. To develop a more broadly acting  <b>vaccine</b>, Ho and his colleagues at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" cat="dispute	island">Taiwan</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia_Sinica" cat="academy">Academia Sinica</a>  took a DNA-based approach. DNA-based  <b>vaccines</b> are made up of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" cat="">DNA</a>  that's been  <b>genetically modified</b> to elicit a  <b>specific immune response</b> and thus  <b>allow</b> a greater level of control over design than do traditional  <b>vaccines</b>.<br><br>Ho and his colleagues focused on the  <b>gene</b> for  <b>hemagglutinin</b>, which produces the  <b>virus</b>'s outer  <b>protein</b> and the one against which human  <b>immune systems</b> respond. They created a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequence" cat="">DNA sequence</a>  for the  <b>gene</b> that produces  <b>hemagglutinin</b>, using pieces of the  <b>gene</b> that are shared among different strains of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1" cat="disease">H5N1</a> , rather than a sequence obtained from a single strain of the  <b>virus</b>.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccination" cat="">DNA vaccines</a>  have many benefits: they are long-lived, stable, require no  <b>refrigeration</b>, can be hastily modified, and can be cheaply and quickly manufactured. But they do have one drawback: injections into  <b>muscle tissue</b> result in very inefficient  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" cat="">DNA</a>  uptake. To address this, Ho and his collaborators turned to a technique called  <b>electroporation</b>, a method that has shown promise in preliminary studies. In  <b>electroporation</b>, the  <b>vaccine</b> is combined with small electrical stimuli at the  <b>injection</b> site; the resulting  <b>electrical field</b> enhances  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" cat="">DNA</a>  uptake by the  <b>muscle cells</b>.<br><br>The study results, published in a recent edition of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences" cat="journal	academy">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> , "show that when you use the  <b>consensus sequence</b> to  <b>immunize</b>  <b>mice</b>, the  <b>mice</b> will mount an  <b>antibody</b> response that's pretty broadly neutralizing for  <b>viruses</b> in different branches of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1" cat="disease">H5N1</a>   <b>tree</b>," Ho says. And when the researchers exposed the  <b>mice</b> to different strains of the  <b>virus</b>, they found that the protection had breadth as well.<br><br>"This is a very interesting, imaginative, and novel approach," says  <b>virologist</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Palese" cat="">Peter Palese</a> , head of the  <b>microbiology</b>  <b>department</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai_School_of_Medicine" cat="university">Mount Sinai School of Medicine</a> , in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> . "It takes advantage of several technological advances, and should be given a chance to be tested in humans."<br><br>Part of what makes the approach so appealing, he notes, is the  <b>vaccine</b>'s ability to stimulate  <b>immunity</b> to multiple virus strains. "The present vaccines are very limited to a particular variant, and if the circulating variant is very different, then we have a problem," says Palese. "The new vaccine will cover more variants around the original strain."<br>
