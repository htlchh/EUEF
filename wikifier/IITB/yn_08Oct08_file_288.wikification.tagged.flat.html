It is not merely a matter of scoring an early '60s Kingsbridge suit by John Taylor Ltd. of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrytown,_New_York" cat="place	village">Tarrytown</a>  ($110 at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peddler" cat="occupation">Cheap Jack</a> 's in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" cat="district">midtown Manhattan</a> ) and a skinny Harry Rothman tie ($45). You can't just  <b>vacuum</b> up  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Strike" cat="brand	introduction">Lucky Strikes</a> . No, if you  <b>want to</b> be a piece of serious  <b>collateral damage</b> in the phenomenon that is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_(TV_network)" cat="">AMC</a> 's " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" cat="winner	show	1960s">Mad Men</a> ," which just won an Emmy for best  <b>drama</b> series, you <b>'ve</b>  <b>got to get</b> the lingo down. To know your dolls from your sweethearts, I mean. "A pack of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Strike" cat="brand	introduction">Lucky Strikes</a> , sweetheart," you say to the  <b>elderly woman</b> behind the counter of a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square" cat="junction">Times Square</a>  bodega, figuring she is well past  <b>doll</b> age. Her face freezes behind the  <b>bifocals</b> for a moment before thawing into  <b>skepticism</b>. You'll get that $9 pack of  <b>cigarettes</b>, but not until she has given you a head-to-toe: the  <b>hair gel</b> as hard and shiny as  <b>patent leather</b>, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff" cat="parts">French cuff</a>  shirt, the  <b>tie clip</b>. You get all the way to the door before hearing the woman break into a nervous cackle. Until that last moment, you note, it was all very  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper" cat="printmaker	person	painter	painting">Edward Hopper</a> . People come to " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" cat="winner	show	1960s">Mad Men</a> " (which is actually filmed on the West Coast) for many reasons. For some, it's the  <b>ad agency</b> at the show's heart,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" cat="winner	show	1960s">Sterling Cooper</a> , where  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" cat="burial	officer	senator	writer	recipient	person	democrat	candidate	politician	president	socialite	personnel	alumnus	nominee	member	biographer	advocate	victim	leaders">Camelot-era</a>  men fire  <b>zingers</b> at  <b>warp speed</b>, and the secretaries forage for husbands. For others, " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" cat="winner	show	1960s">Mad Men</a> ," with its almost  <b>orgiastic</b>  <b>parade</b> of twin sets and  <b>crinoline</b>, is a kind of  <b>fashion</b>  <b>porn</b>. But  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" cat="winner	show	1960s">Sterling Cooper</a>  is also a profoundly sad place. Haunted men  <b>booze</b> it up in the morning, visit  <b>mistresses</b> in the afternoon, chain-smoke the rest of the time; the women either put up with constant  <b>sexist</b> epithets on the job or abandon them for lives of misery in  <b>suburbia</b>. What do we love about this show again?  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" cat="winner	show	1960s">Sterling Cooper</a>  is at  <b>405</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Avenue_(Manhattan)" cat="">Madison Ave.</a> , an address that ... does not exist. But don't worry, soon it will be  <b>11:30</b> and time for your first  <b>cocktail</b>.

It is just as  <b>somber</b> as a place dedicated to illicitness should be.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch" cat="meal">Lunch time</a> ! Luckily  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_Bar" cat="establishment	restaurant">the Oyster Bar</a>  at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal" cat="stations	terminal	attraction	landmark">Grand Central Terminal</a>  is just a few blocks away. The red-checkered  <b>tablecloths</b> are exactly as they were on the day Don and Roger  <b>overdid</b> it. The  <b>restaurant</b> employs three shuckers during lunch, as well as another guy who does only  <b>stews</b>. Dozens of kinds of  <b>mollusks</b> from two  <b>oceans</b> are available on any given day. Come to think of it, maybe you <b>'d</b> like to take the rest of the day off and have a  <b>tryst</b> with office siren/head secretary Joan in her modest  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village" cat="village	district">Greenwich Village</a>  flat. No can do. Joan was  <b>long ago</b> priced out of her place at 42 W. 12th, a street where the going price for a studio is two grand a month, and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)" cat="film	play">Gaslight</a>  (at 116 MacDougal) has morphed into a  <b>tattoo parlor</b>. Wait. Wasn't this the night you promised to take the wife to "Fiorello!" even though you hate  <b>musicals</b>, just like Don? Oh, well, it'll be worth it to see the society ladies in their  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kors" cat="designer	brand	person	jew">Michael Kors</a>  (the designer having been such a " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" cat="winner	show	1960s">Mad Men</a> " nut that he based his fall collection on the show). Be advised, however, that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadhurst_Theatre" cat="">Broadhurst Theater</a>  is home no longer to a singing  <b>mayor</b> but to a naked  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" cat="introduction">Harry Potter</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Radcliffe" cat="actor	activist	person	citizen	jew	atheist">Daniel Radcliffe</a>  in " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(play)" cat="play">Equus</a> "). A pre-show dinner will be a must, and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardi's" cat="restaurant">Sardi</a> 's, once the happening spot, is now just sort-of-happening-kind-of. Desperation: Maybe that's what it is. With each passing day, more and more desperation seems to grip  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> . The city leaves you with the same feeling that " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" cat="winner	show	1960s">Mad Men</a> " does, and, who knows, maybe that's the real reason the show speaks to us so compellingly. It all makes you  <b>want to</b> scare up a copy of "Meditations in an Emergency," as Don did, and seek out a quiet spot for mulling over  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_O'Hara" cat="person	writer	personnel	critic	curator	poet	alumnus">Frank O'Hara</a> 's poetry: Now I am  <b>quietly</b> waiting for the catastrophe of my personality to seem beautiful again, and interesting, and modern. IF YOU GO STAYING THERE: With the average price of a room now hovering at about $350 a night, booking  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" cat="place	seats	names">Manhattan</a>   <b>hotel</b> rooms is not for the faint of heart. We found rooms at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_Hotel_(New_York)" cat="hotel	establishment">Roosevelt Hotel</a>  (45 E. 45th St., 888-833-3969, ) for as low as $195 a night, although you could easily pay twice that or more during busy periods. One new budget option is the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jane" cat="">Jane Hotel</a>  (113 Jane St., 212-924-6700, ) in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Village" cat="">West Village</a> , where an unbelievably small room (50 square feet) with one single bed (shared bath down the hall) goes for $99. EATING/DRINKING THERE: Just off the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" cat="person	episcopalian	candidate	nominee	politician	alumnus	member	leaders	philatelist	lawyer	president	recipient	senator	democrat">Roosevelt</a> 's  <b>glittering</b> lobby, the Madison Club Lounge is great for a pre-show drink or late-night  <b>cocktail</b>. Not far away is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_Bar" cat="establishment	restaurant">the Oyster Bar</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal" cat="stations	terminal	attraction	landmark">Grand Central Terminal</a>  (212-490-6650), where a platter of eight  <b>oysters</b> on the half  <b>shell</b> goes for about $18 (depending on the market) and a  <b>pint</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Point,_New_York" cat="place	hamlet">Blue Point</a>   <b>lager</b> is $6.50. Reservations are strongly recommended at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardi's" cat="restaurant">Sardi</a> 's (234 W. 44th St., 212-221-8440), especially for pretheater dining. They <b>'ve</b> been serving the cannelloni au gratin ($25.75) - a  <b>crepe</b> stuffed with beef, veal and pork and topped with a  <b>tomato</b>  <b>cream sauce</b> - for decades. P.J. Clarke's has three locations ( ). I visited the original at  <b>915</b> Third Ave. (212-317-1616) and had a great corned beef Reuben ($13) with a  <b>cone</b> of shoestring  <b>fries</b> ($4.30). In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village" cat="village	district">Greenwich Village</a> , the Esperanto Cafe (114 MacDougal St.) is open 24 hours and makes for a great  <b>breakfast</b> spot.
