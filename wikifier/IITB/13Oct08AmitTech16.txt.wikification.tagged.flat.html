And yet, although the military version of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS</a>  includes security features such as  <b>encryption</b>, civilian signals are transmitted in the clear. Now, researchers at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University" cat="university	attraction	institution">Cornell University</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University" cat="school	university	institution	attraction	college">Virginia Tech</a>  have demonstrated a relatively simple way to fool ordinary  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS receivers</a>  into accepting bogus signals using a briefcase-size  <b>transmitter</b>.<br><br>Paul Kintner, a  <b>professor</b> of  <b>electrical and computer engineering</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University" cat="university	attraction	institution">Cornell</a> , who worked on the project, warns that society is becoming dependent on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS</a>  for an ever-broadening list of applications, including management of the  <b>power grid</b> and tracking criminals under  <b>house arrest</b>. "I'm just  <b>amazed</b> at the way people are using these  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS systems</a> ," Kintner says. "Ten years from now, there will be more ways that we just don't know about--it migrates into our technological  <b>fabric</b>, and we become dependent on it."<br><br>Kintner and his group, which recently presented details of the  <b>spoofing attack</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Navigation" cat="organization	society	institute">Institute of Navigation</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_navigation_satellite_system" cat="stations	system	avionics	instrument">Global Navigation Satellite Systems</a>  (GNSS) meeting in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia" cat="place	seats	city	dispute	settlement	capital">Savannah, GA</a> , did not start out  <b>looking</b> for a way to subvert  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS</a> . They were working on a software-based  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS receiver</a>  to help them understand the effects of  <b>solar flares</b> on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS satellites</a> . But as their design progressed, Todd Humphreys, one of the researchers in the group, realized that the same system could be used to spoof ordinary  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals" cat="">GPS signals</a> .<br><br>Here's how GPS works: roughly 30  <b>satellites</b>  <b>orbit</b> the earth, broadcasting signals that can be picked up by a  <b>receiver</b> virtually anywhere on the  <b>planet</b>. By collecting signals from several  <b>satellites</b> and measuring the time delay between each signal,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS receivers</a>  can calculate their exact position and receive very precise time signals.<br><br>The  <b>software</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_navigation_system" cat="accessory	system	devices	technology">GPS device</a>  built at Cornell can receive and transmit any  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals" cat="">GPS signal</a> . To attack a target  <b>receiver</b>, the device need only be placed nearby. It would start out simply retransmitting ordinary  <b>satellite</b> signals without any modifications. After a few seconds, the target  <b>receiver</b> should focus on the signal coming from the device, because it's the clearest source. At that point, the device could begin modifying transmissions, altering the signals little by little until the target  <b>receiver</b> shows any time and position the attacker chooses. Kintner says that an attacker could use fake  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals" cat="">GPS signals</a>  to disrupt the  <b>power grid</b>, potentially causing  <b>power spikes</b> and even damaging  <b>generators</b>. The same trick could let criminals under  <b>house arrest</b> move around freely, he adds.<br><br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Langley" cat="footballer	person	player	midfielders">Richard Langley</a> , a  <b>professor</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Department" cat="">the Department</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy" cat="loanword">Geodesy</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics" cat="">Geomatics</a>  at the University of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick" cat="colony	dispute	province	state">New Brunswick</a> , in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" cat="country	nation	colony	member	state">Canada</a> , who has worked extensively with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS</a> , says that this potential weak spot in the  <b>technology</b> has, in fact, been known for years, although little has been done to date to protect the  <b>civilian system</b> against it. "You would think that more would have been developed by now," he says, "but maybe it takes the demonstration that these guys have carried out to show how easily a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS receiver</a>  can be spoofed."<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langley" cat="">Langley</a>  notes that solutions are some distance away. Although a European  <b>navigation system</b>, called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation)" cat="stations	system">Galileo</a> , will have the ability to send  <b>encrypted signals</b> for civilian use, it isn't scheduled to be  <b>fully</b> operational until  <b>2013</b>. It would be possible to add  <b>encryption</b> to the existing system, but  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langley,_Slough" cat="">Langley</a>  says that the likely cost and disruption make this an unlikely solution. The  <b>best bet</b> in the  <b>near term</b>, he says, is to add security features to normal  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS receivers</a> .<br><br>One option would be to add more  <b>antennas</b> to receivers. The attack relies on the fact that most consumer  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System" cat="system	avionics	invention	stations	game">GPS receivers</a>  use just a single  <b>antenna</b> to receive signals from multiple  <b>satellites</b>. By adding multiple  <b>antennas</b>, a normal  <b>receiver</b> could recognize that the spoofed signals in fact come from only one source. But Langley notes that there would be a cost  <b>trade-off</b>. "Manufacturers have to get a return on any investment they make in antispoofing  <b>technology</b>," he says.<br><br>Kintner says that manufacturers have time to respond before attacks become realistic, but he warns that  <b>countermeasures</b> have to be introduced. "We live in a time where we're really dependent on  <b>technology</b>," he says. "We  <b>need to</b> understand how that makes us vulnerable."<br><br>If the  <b>technology</b> needed to make a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack" cat="">GPS spoofing</a>  device is miniaturized, then  <b>handheld devices</b> could be produced for about $1,000 each, Kintner warns. "My greatest fear is that someone will reduce it to the size of a  <b>cigarette pack</b>, and the world will be flooded with these small devices at a fairly cheap price," he says. "That would make GPS useless in a whole variety of circumstances."<br><br>
