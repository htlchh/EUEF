Gerry Wildy, 38, is embarking on a  <b>one-day</b>  <b>fundraising</b> bike ride on Saturday,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_4" cat="days">October 4</a> , in an attempt to raise at least £2,500 to take part in an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arctic_Challenge" cat="festival	competition	record">Arctic Challenge</a> , in aid of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Severn" cat="navigation	river">Severn</a>  Sounds  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money" cat="economics">Money</a>  Mountain. In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2009" cat="">February 2009</a> , Gerry will be  <b>enduring</b> -30c temperatures as part of a 14-strong team, learning  <b>survival techniques</b> such as building a shelter, ice-fishing and cooking on an open fire. First, however, he has arranged to cycle with three others from his  <b>farm</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slimbridge" cat="village">Slimbridge</a> , via  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leominster" cat="town">Leominster</a> , to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadbury_plc" cat="company	manufacturer	brand	holder	food	chocolatiers">Cadbury</a>  factory in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bournville" cat="village	area">Bournville</a>  where the  <b>milk</b> from his  <b>farm</b> is used in the production of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadbury_plc" cat="company	manufacturer	brand	holder	food	chocolatiers">Cadbury</a>   <b>chocolate</b>. Gerry says, "I have chosen this route as our  <b>farm</b> supplies  <b>milk</b> to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadbury_plc" cat="company	manufacturer	brand	holder	food	chocolatiers">Cadburys</a> . Its the way the  <b>tanker</b>  <b>goes</b> once leaving our  <b>farm</b> to the factory. " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadbury_plc" cat="company	manufacturer	brand	holder	food	chocolatiers">Cadburys</a>  have been really supportive of me doing this and have very kindly agreed to match the amount we raise. They will also be supplying  <b>chocolate</b> to all the challengers when we do the challenge, which is greatly appreciated."
