WOODSTOCK  <b>ý</b> Workers from F & A  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscaping" cat="">Landscaping</a>  took advantage of the cool weather Tuesday to work on a  <b>hardscaping</b> project in a new development in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock" cat="">Woodstock</a>  where the crew has done a number of  <b>landscaping projects</b> this summer.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Flynn_(footballer)" cat="person	player">Pat Flynn</a>  of Sykesville-based Pat’s Garden and F & A Landscaping was in the front yard looking at a new bed the homeowners wanted next to the path leading to their house. She held a series of  <b>plant</b> tags for a range of  <b>perennials</b>, trying to determine how many of each to use. While the drive to be outside and work on the  <b>lawn</b> and  <b>garden</b> may decrease with waning daylight,  <b>garden</b> experts say fall is a time to be seized when it comes to landscaping. “There are all sorts of things you can do this time of year,” Flynn said. Maintenance is one of the most common things to do in fall, Flynn said, such as raking up  <b>leaves</b>, pulling out dead plants and refreshing  <b>mulch</b> beds. But it’s also a great time to think ahead for next year, planning new  <b>garden</b> beds, planting bushes and  <b>shrubs</b> and even most spring bulbs. “Trees and shrubs acclimate [to their new surroundings] in their dormant stage, giving them a jump on the  <b>growing season</b>,” Flynn said. Steve Allgeier, home  <b>horticulture</b> specialist at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_County,_Maryland" cat="establishment	county">Carroll</a>  office of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland" cat="state">Maryland</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_extension_service" cat="university">Cooperative Extension</a> , said fall is also a great time to  <b>tackle</b> your  <b>lawn</b> with aerating, seeding and fertilizing. “In the spring, your  <b>lawn</b> is going to grow anyway,” Allgeier said, but the fall is when it can use an actual boost.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_seeding" cat="list">Seeding</a>  also does better in the fall because there’s less heat, he said, but homeowners who haven’t seeded yet should try to get it done in the next week or so before it gets too cool. Allgeier agreed that fall is a great time to  <b>plant</b> new trees and  <b>shrubs</b>. But for people who don’t know what they  <b>want to</b> change about their  <b>garden</b>, the fall is a good time to take an  <b>inventory</b> of what they planted in the spring and decide what worked well and what didn’t. Often, people are too busy to really think about the success of their gardens during the summer, he said, but reviewing your outcomes at the end of the season can help you plan better for next spring. Keith Pitrone, an assistant manager at Meadows Farms Nurseries in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster" cat="district	town">Westminster</a> , said he noticed people with fall  <b>landscaping</b> in mind coming into the store about two weeks ago. A lot of people start to see the  <b>leaves</b> change and  <b>want to</b> add something to their yard to have more  <b>fall color</b>, he said. Some of their top fall sellers include autumn blaze maples, burning bush, nadina and dogwoods, he said. Trees and  <b>shrubs</b> can be planted up until the first hard frost, he said. “Fall is the second planting season,” Pitrone said. “I’d rather  <b>plant</b> in the fall, then you don’t have to  <b>drag</b> your plants through the summer heat.” Flynn said not all fall plants can be bought now for the  <b>best show</b> in the  <b>garden</b>. Mums, for example, do best when planted in August if the homeowner wants them to come back on their own each year. Mums planted in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_September" cat="album">late September</a>  or in October tend not to come back, she said.
