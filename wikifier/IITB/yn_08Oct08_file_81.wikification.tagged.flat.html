Featuring 3,384 bottles, the record-breaking collection was built up over 35 years by Brazilian  <b>whisky</b> enthusiast Claive Vidiz. Mr Vidiz has scoured the world for  <b>whiskies</b> to create the collection, which has been bought by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diageo" cat="distillery	company	brand">Diageo</a> . The  <b>whisky</b> manufacturer will be loaning the collection to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky" cat="">Scotch Whisky</a>  Experience on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mile" cat="venue">the Royal Mile</a>  next year.

While the details of the terms of its sale to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diageo" cat="distillery	company	brand">Diageo</a>  remain under wraps, the unique collection is described by  <b>whisky</b> experts as "invaluable" and ranges from the most popular  <b>whiskies</b> to some of the rarest. Mr Vadiz said: "To split up a collection which I have devoted more than 35 years of my life to would have broken my heart so I am  <b>truly</b>  <b>thrilled</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diageo" cat="distillery	company	brand">Diageo</a>  has purchased it in its  <b>entirety</b>.

Limited edition One of only 100 bottles ever produced, this  <b>limited edition</b>  <b>centenary</b>  <b>malt</b> was offered to a very select few, including various heads of state.

Bought in  <b>1969</b> for US $1,000, it was the most expensive  <b>limited edition</b> bottle of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky" cat="">Scotch whisky</a>  on the market at the time. Shipping the fragile cargo across the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" cat="">Atlantic</a>  took months of preparation and each bottle was individually packaged by  <b>fine art</b> specialists. "We are delighted to have worked with Claive to bring this wonderful collection safely back to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a>  and to play a part in preserving its legacy and historic significance," said Bryan  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donaghey" cat="village	townlands">Donaghey</a> ,  <b>managing director</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Distillers" cat="">Diageo Scotland</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisitScotland" cat="body	organisation	establishment	relations">VisitScotland</a> 's chief executive, Philip Riddle said: "The return of such an important and interesting collection of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky" cat="">Scotch whisky</a>  to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a>  is fantastic news, particularly as we look forward to Homecoming  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scotland</a>   <b>2009</b>."
