With the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism" cat="dispute">Maoist</a>  government making no move to appoint a new  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a> , the priests used their own initiative to select  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranthodendron" cat="plant	tree">Manita</a>  Sunday. In the past, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a> , believed to be the protecting  <b>deity</b> of the  <b>royal family</b>, was chosen on the basis of her  <b>horoscope</b>, which had to be compatible with the king's. Then she received an audience with the king. But with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanendra_of_Nepal" cat="pretender	marshals	person	dispute	recipient	crosse	ruler">Gyanendra</a>  being formally stripped of his crown in May and  <b>monarchy</b> being abolished, nimble-witted priests selected  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranthodendron" cat="plant	tree">Manita</a>  on the basis of the 32 auspicious signs her horoscope is  <b>said to</b> possess. Instead of the king, she was granted an audience the very same day by President  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Baran_Yadav" cat="member	president	leaders	person	politician	expatriate">Ram Baran Yadav</a> , who has replaced  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanendra_of_Nepal" cat="pretender	marshals	person	dispute	recipient	crosse	ruler">Gyanendra</a>  as the new head of  <b>state</b>. The little girl, wide-eyed but  <b>displaying</b> no sign of  <b>nervousness</b>, was Sunday carried to her  <b>chariot</b> pulled by enthusiastic devotees and officially appointed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu" cat="place	capital">Kathmandu</a> 's protective  <b>deity</b> after an ornate worship in  <b>accordance</b> with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu" cat="">Hindu</a>   <b>tantric</b> traditions.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranthodendron" cat="plant	tree">Manita</a> 's appointment comes within a week of neighbouring  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaktapur_District" cat="">Bhaktapur district</a>  also choosing a new  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a> , six-year-old Shreeya  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajracharya" cat="title	teacher">Bajracharya</a> , to fill the post of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaktapur" cat="place">Bhaktapur</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  that had been lying vacant for about eight months after her predecessor  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumari_(children)" cat="person	temple	dispute">Sajani Shakya</a>  quit. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  is a tradition that goes back over three centuries, and one the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism" cat="dispute">Maoists</a>  have not dared to challenge though they waged war against the king, who was once worshipped as an incarnation of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu" cat="">Hindu</a>   <b>god</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu" cat="words	deity	character	names	form">Vishnu</a> .

The tradition was successfully challenged to some extent only by a woman from the same community, a  <b>lawyer</b> named Pundevi  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharjan" cat="">Maharjan</a> , in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepal</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India" cat="court">Supreme Court</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharjan" cat="">Maharjan</a>  filed a  <b>public interest litigation</b>, saying the  <b>deification</b> and installation of little girls in isolated palaces robbed them of basic rights like the right to  <b>education</b>.
