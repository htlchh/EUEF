Psychological and physical challenges inevitably set in, tempers flare,  <b>romance</b> blooms and hearts are broken as housemates attempt to get along. Many of us love this show. We are addicted to it. It keeps us entertained. We start "adoring" the participants. We take sides, and fall in love with them or maybe their character. But have you ever sat down and thought about the other side of the  <b>coin</b>, the  <b>psychological</b> bit of it? An emotional Lucille  <b>hugs</b> a housemate after she was  <b>told</b> that head of house Takwonda had saved himself and put her up for possible  <b>eviction</b>. The truth is, participants in this show go through  <b>hell</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Bulgaria)" cat="">Big Brother</a>  housemates are  <b>subjected</b> to  <b>torture</b>. Well the whole game is about exerting as much pressure as possible on people from different  <b>walks</b> of life. So they actually agree to the terms and even sign contracts to take part. It is all about the  <b>$100,000</b>. But don't these mind games and the whole experience take their toll, psychologically and physically, on the housemates? The dietary manipulation,  <b>diary room</b> sessions, sleep deprivation, temporary confusion,  <b>stress positions</b> and  <b>soundproofed</b> isolation for almost three months cannot be an easy environment to live in. The same house, same faces, décor and the same everything. You don't know what the time of day or night it is; neither do you know the day or the month. The house is like a  <b>laboratory</b>. But the dream of instant fame and the chance of fortune, just out of reach on the other side of the world is an incentive to push the housemates to great lengths. Dr Vincent Karuhanga, a general practitioner at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends" cat="ending	sitcom	winner	rating	show">Friends</a>  Polyclinic and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance" cat="vehicle">Ambulance</a>  Services, is of the view that the mere fact that someone is confined in one place for a  <b>long time</b> is enough to cause  <b>psychological stress</b>. "Confinement goes with lack of association like social engagements, association with family and lack of information," Dr Karuhanga says. "These are young people so they are sexually active. Every  <b>72 hours</b>, maturation of  <b>sperms</b> takes place so if they are not let out in form of having  <b>sex</b>, then someone can experience sexual  <b>starvation</b> which can lead to  <b>sexual perversions</b>. There is no  <b>privacy</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Bulgaria)" cat="">Big Brother</a>  House so the housemates are not exactly free to have  <b>sex</b> because they know  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" cat="">Africa</a>  is watching. This alone causes a lot of  <b>stress</b>." Big Brother introduced the  <b>rubbish dump</b> which Tawana and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Toya_Jackson" cat="contestant	musician	singer	witness	person	activist	officer	vegetarian">Latoya</a>  were banished to.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(song)" cat="singles	ballad	song	symbol	record">Imagine</a>  being taken away from a fancy house blindfolded and when the  <b>blindfold</b> is removed, you find yourself in the middle of a rubbish pit. You are further informed that you are to spend a week in there. At the end of the seven days, one of you has to leave the game, for good. You are tortured both physically because you have to clean up the dump and psychologically because you are thinking, "What did I do wrong to deserve this?" A lot of  <b>emotional stress</b> is experienced by the housemates. Some fall in love but are so conscious of what the viewers will think. Others are acting because they  <b>want to</b> stay longer in there. In the end, they break people's hearts. Maureen and Tatiana of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_Africa" cat="">Big Brother Africa</a>  II must also have been victims because they were in love in the house only to come out and reality struck. Richard goes back to his wife and Code is received by his pregnant fiancé so the stories kind of end there. REVIEW:  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia" cat="country	member	state	dispute">Zambia</a> 's Takondwa and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya" cat="country	member	nation	state">Kenya</a> 's Sheila are open about their relationship. Currently, Tawana is fighting a losing battle. She thought spending a night in Takondwa's bed meant he was in love with her. The truth dawned on her when Takondwa told her that he had a "thing" for Sheila, not her. Munya has also been hurting because of his  <b>undying</b> love for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Bluth" cat="">Lucille</a>  who would not reciprocate it. Such are the  <b>love games</b> in the house. But you cannot avoid meeting your housemates because you see them on a daily basis. The nominations are another thing that keeps the housemates' adrenaline high. Tawana cried after she had been nominated. In the first  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Bulgaria)" cat="">Big Brother</a>  season, you would know if you are in the  <b>comfort zone</b> or not because housemates' nominations were not changed. But in the latest two seasons, Big Brother introduced  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Head" cat="cartoon">the Head</a>  of House twist which gives the head of house power to save someone on the nomination list and replace them with a housemate of their choice. Relevant Links Poor Lucille is the latest victim of this  <b>torture</b>. She was only nominated by one person and was therefore "safe", only to replace TK and actually get evicted from the house. To  <b>relieve</b> his tension,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utik" cat="region	dispute">Uti</a>  stood up and pulled down the  <b>blinds</b> in the  <b>glass house</b> after Lucille's name was called out. When he returned to the house, he kicked stands and broke cups and plates. Any one would think the guy had run mad.
