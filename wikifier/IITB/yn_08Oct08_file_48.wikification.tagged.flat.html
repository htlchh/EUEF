It would have been a far more appropriate spot for two of the league's oddities to converge in this post-bye week for the teams. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a>  (3-0) are one of the league's worst teams after a  <b>bye</b>. How can one explain the 4-15 record, that includes a  <b>1-3</b> mark under current  <b>coach</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Coughlin" cat="person	coach	packer	back	player	sportspeople">Tom Coughlin</a>  ? The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks" cat="club	team	sport">Seahawks</a>  (1-2) don't handle travel well, especially when the destination is the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" cat="">East Coast</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Holmgren" cat="person	sportspeople	coach	evangelicals	manager	christian	quarterback	player">Mike Holmgren</a> 's group is 1-5 in its last six trips, and 3-7 in its last 10 games away from home. The one  <b>cross-country</b> trip this season resulted in a 34-10 loss at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills" cat="bill	club	team	sport">Buffalo</a> . "If I were a fan this one would be hard to pick,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a>  defensive tackle  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Cofield" cat="player	person">Barry Cofield</a>  said, noting that both streaks are inexplicable. Holmgren seemed to have fun when questioned about his team's travel  <b>woes</b>. "I <b>'m</b> not frustrated. What do you mean?" he said playfully banging his fist on a table. "It's something we know we have to do. You  <b>coach</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington" cat="">Seattle</a>  , we're on the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" cat="">West Coast</a> , you know you're going to travel. That's the deal. It is a frustration that we have not played as well as I think we're capable of playing at times on the road. That's the frustration." The oddities aside, this is a game that might be decided by the receivers - the addition of two for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks" cat="club	team	sport">Seattle</a>  and the absence of one for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLI" cat="">Super Bowl champions</a>  . Leading  <b>receiver</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaxico_Burress" cat="criminal	prisoner	person	player	survivor	receiver">Plaxico Burress</a>  has been suspended by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a>  for missing a team activity on Sept. 22, the day after they beat Cincinnati in  <b>overtime</b>. Burress, who blamed his absence on a family issue, is the team's deep threat and the top  <b>receiver</b> in scoring position. He led the team with a career-high 12  <b>touchdown</b> catches last season.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_year" cat="years">Third-year</a>  pro  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domenik_Hixon" cat="receiver	specialist	person	player	sportspeople">Domenik Hixon</a>  will make his first  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League" cat="league	cooperative	supraorganizations">NFL</a>  start, replacing him at  <b>split end</b>. "I am not worried about it,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a>  middle  <b>linebacker</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Pierce" cat="person	player	linebacker">Antonio Pierce</a>  said. "If  <b>anybody</b> has been watching whenever those guys get their number called -  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(Carolina_Panthers)" cat="">Steve Smith</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hixon_rail_crash" cat="accident	disaster">Hixon</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Manningham" cat="player	alumnus	person	receiver">Mario Manningham</a>  if he is playing - all those guys are capable of putting up big numbers. They are all explosive. They all, I think, are pretty much itching for the opportunity to go out there and showcase what they have." The play of the youngsters and veteran  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amani_Toomer" cat="player	receiver	person">Amani Toomer</a>  will be important because Seattle has had success stopping the run. It is ranked No. 4 in the league, yielding an average of 88 yards. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a>  are averaging 157 yards rushing, which has allowed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning" cat="player	quarterback	person	alumnus	pick">Eli Manning</a>  to  <b>pick and choose</b> when to throw. "They are putting eight guys up in the box sometimes where they are making you throw," Manning said. "That is what we are going to have to do. We are going to try to establish the run and hopefully we will get that going. But if they are putting too many guys up there, then we will have to throw it, and we have to find completions and make some plays." The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks" cat="club	team	sport">Seahawks</a>  have been running the ball better than the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a> . With  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Jones" cat="back	player	person">Julius Jones</a>  posting two consecutive 100-yard games, they have averaged 166.3 yards on the ground.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Hasselbeck" cat="sportspeople	person	quarterback	player	christian">Matt Hasselbeck</a>  and the passing game have only produced roughly 170 on average, but this week the offence gets back veteran receivers  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Engram" cat="person	recipient	player	receiver">Bobby Engram</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Branch" cat="player	person	receiver">Deion Branch</a>  for the first time this season. Branch, who had 49  <b>receptions</b> and four  <b>touchdowns</b> in 11 games last season, is coming back from  <b>knee surgery</b>. Engram, who had 94 catches for 1,147 yards and six  <b>touchdowns</b>, is returning from a shoulder injury. "They have had some issues there at  <b>wide receiver</b> since the beginning of the season," Coughlin said. "They have talked about that openly, so I <b>'m</b> just mimicking what they said. Now that gives them the balance they need. They are veterans and they know how to play. And so those two are back. So they will be at pretty much full strength." While the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks" cat="club	team	sport">Seahawks</a>  have downplayed their problems with the  <b>bye</b> and travel, a lot of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  players will be  <b>looking</b> for a little payback. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks" cat="club	team	sport">Seahawks</a>  ripped the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a>  42-30 two years ago in a game in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks" cat="club	team	sport">Seattle</a>  that was not that close. Hasselbeck had a career-high five  <b>touchdown</b> passes, helping his team build a 35-3 halftime lead. What made the game more memorable for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  was that former  <b>tight end</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Shockey" cat="person	player">Jeremy Shockey</a>  compounded the loss by saying Coughlin and his staff were outcoached. "It's exciting for us," tackle  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Diehl" cat="player	guard	person	sportspeople">David Diehl</a>  said. "In '05 and '06 those five-hour flights coming home from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington" cat="">Seattle</a>  were not fun. Those games left a terrible taste in our mouths, and now it is time to do something about it." Center  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_O'Hara" cat="person	player	sportspeople	center">Shaun O'Hara</a>  said it will be fun not hearing all the  <b>noise</b> the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington" cat="">Seattle</a>  fans make. "My only request is that our fans return the favour and bring their noisemakers and do their part to get them to have 15 false starts," he said.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup" cat="">Backup</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants" cat="team	club">Giants</a>  guard  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Ruegamer" cat="person	player	center	guard">Grey Ruegamer</a>  smirked when asked about the Giants' bye-week blahs and the Seahawks' travel woes. "It's  <b>poppycock</b>," he said. "You can look at stats and everything else. It's irrelevant. The game will be decided on the field."
