's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)" cat="party">Liberals</a>  trail by 5  <b>percentage points</b> in the latest daily poll by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanos_Research" cat="company">Nanos Research</a> , compared with an 11- point shortfall on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2" cat="days">Oct. 2</a> . The Liberals' 29 percent support was close to a  <b>two-week</b> high and the Conservatives were at a low of 34 percent. The Liberals' recent surge has made it ``very difficult'' for Harper to win a majority, said , a  <b>political science</b>  <b>professor</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleton_University" cat="institution">Carleton University</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa" cat="place	community	district	capital">Ottawa</a> . For the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Liberals</a> , denying Harper a majority ``would be a success from the point of view of where they started at the beginning of the campaign,'' he said. Dion used two televised debates last week to intensify his attacks on Harper for not having a detailed plan to restore confidence in the economy. Harper called  <b>elections</b> Sept. 7 saying Parliament was too  <b>gridlocked</b> for his agenda to succeed, and on Sept. 26 indicated he needs a majority to guide the  <b>economy</b> through an slump and the  <b>global credit crisis</b>. Harper has argued  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_DiMucci" cat="singer	person	performer	musician	catholic">Dion</a> 's plan to fund  <b>tax</b> breaks through a new levy on  <b>pollution</b> is ``risky'' and would cause  <b>budget deficits</b>. `` <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_DiMucci" cat="singer	person	performer	musician	catholic">Dion</a>  decided to turn a little more of the pointed attention toward the  <b>prime minister</b>,'' said Andre Albinati, a former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Liberal</a>  policy adviser and  <b>strategist</b>. ``Voters got to see a side of him that wasn't through the  <b>lens</b> of either the media or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" cat="party">Conservative</a>  ads.'' Short of Majority Still, another daily poll by showed the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Liberals</a>  clawing back to 24 percent from a low of 22 percent and the Conservatives falling to 34 percent. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Conservatives</a>  were 27 seats short of a majority when Harper called the election for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_14" cat="days">Oct. 14</a>  and need about 40 percent of the national vote to reverse that. Former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Liberal</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada" cat="">Prime Minister</a>  , who led  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" cat="country	nation	colony	member	state">Canada</a> 's last three majority governments, got 38 percent of the popular vote in  <b>1997</b> and 40 percent or higher in  <b>1993</b> and  <b>2000</b>. Dion, 53, said in an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October" cat="month">Oct.</a>  4 interview that Harper squandered  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" cat="country	nation	colony	member	state">Canada</a> 's  <b>budget surplus</b>, putting the  <b>economy</b> at risk. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Liberal</a>  plan to penalize carbon-based  <b>pollution</b> to  <b>finance</b> cuts in corporate and  <b>personal income taxes</b> will boost the  <b>economy</b> without raising overall  <b>tax</b> bills,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_DiMucci" cat="singer	person	performer	musician	catholic">Dion</a>  said. ``We don't think  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" cat="country	nation	colony	member	state">Canadians</a>   <b>need to</b> pay more taxes,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_DiMucci" cat="singer	person	performer	musician	catholic">Dion</a>  said by phone from the  <b>province</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island" cat="province	state	colony">Prince Edward Island</a> , adding that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" cat="country	nation	colony	member	state">Canada</a>  must be ``pro-active'' in helping manufacturers that are struggling.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Liberal</a>  Plan The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Liberals</a> , should they gain power, would accelerate already-budgeted investments to stimulate the  <b>economy</b>, Dion said. Still, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada" cat="party">Liberal</a>  leader said he doesn't anticipate new fiscal measures until the next budget in early  <b>2009</b>, to ensure the country doesn't fall into  <b>deficit</b>. The next government won't have much extra cash to work with anyway. Harper's administration has forecast a surplus of C$2.3 billion ($2.1 billion) for the  <b>fiscal year</b> that started  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_1" cat="days">April 1</a> , down 76 percent from the previous year.
