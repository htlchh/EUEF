That's just my sense."<br>RELATED: CANDIDATES NEED TO TALK TO AMERICA - AND EACH OTHER<br><br>The first two debates were generally considered draws. Some blamed the candidates for refusing to go beyond talking points, while some blamed the  <b>moderators</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lehrer" cat="anchor	recipient	officer	person	winner	analyst">Jim Lehrer</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brokaw" cat="person	anchor	reporter	broadcaster	writer	analyst">Tom Brokaw</a> , for not pushing harder.<br><br>After the last  <b>presidential debate</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_Times" cat="newspaper">St. Petersburg Times</a>   <b>media critic</b> Eric Deggans wrote that he hoped Schieffer would "take every opportunity to remind each man when his time for speechifying is over, and push them to actually answer questions they are asked."<br><br>Schieffer, host of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" cat="owner	company	winner	establishment	network">CBS'</a>  " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation" cat="winner	show">Face the Nation</a> ," said the past  <b>moderators</b> were hamstrung by the format, and the candidates realize tomorrow is their last chance to make a point before a massive TV audience.<br><br>"I try not to think about this too much, but it's hard not to stop and think the whole election could change on this debate," Schieffer said. "This race is so close, nobody has broken away enough with a big lead, this is all yet to be decided."<br><br>The format tomorrow may help. Unlike the past debates, the two candidates will sit  <b>nearly</b> side by side on one half of a half-moon shaped table where they'll face Schieffer. There will be eight, maybe nine, 10-minute segments. Schieffer will  <b>tee</b> up the first question, the candidates will answer, and, if all goes well, debate each other over the topic.<br><br>"I will  <b>encourage</b> them to question each other about something that was said, or allegations made," Schieffer said. "My hope is you won't hear as much from me as you will them."<br><br>He also vows to get them back on track if they veer off into  <b>talking points</b> and dodge questions.<br><br>The debate comes after what has been a  <b>nearly</b> two-year election cycle, one often labeled the most important of the past few decades.<br><br>Schieffer recalled talking to the late  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a>  " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press" cat="program	winner	show">Meet the Press</a> " moderator  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Russert" cat="person	broadcaster	writer	journalist	lawyer	burial	catholic	alumnus	anchor	figure	analyst	democrat	winner">Tim Russert</a>  about the intensity of the campaign, and how neither wanted to miss it. "I wish Tim could kind of be here with me," he said. "I really think about that a lot, and how much he would have loved to be here."<br><br>For Schieffer, 71, the debate is another  <b>milepost</b> in what has been an  <b>incredible</b> ride - one he was expecting to be his last as moderator of " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation" cat="winner	show">Face the Nation</a> ." Initial plans to retire in January have been scrapped.

"You're never going to please all the fans, nor should we. Everybody has a right to their opinion. I don't expect everybody who watches this debate will think I did a good job."<br><br>rhuff@nydailynews.com<br>
