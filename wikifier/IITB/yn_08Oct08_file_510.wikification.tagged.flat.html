GettyImages  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Björgólfur_Guðmundsson" cat="">Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson</a> 's assets have taken a significant hit which will hit West  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham" cat="district">Ham</a> . Hammers chairman  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Björgólfur_Guðmundsson" cat="">Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson</a>  is a major  <b>shareholder</b> in the  <b>bank</b>, the second biggest in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" cat="state	country	member	republic	colony">Iceland</a> , and chaired the company until he was sacked yesterday when the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" cat="state	country	member	republic	colony">Iceland</a>  government took control. Amid growing fears that the club will either be sold or that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianfranco_Zola" cat="person	player	manager	footballer	officer">Gianfranco Zola</a>  will be unable to strengthen his squad in January both  <b>chief executive</b> Scott  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duxbury,_Massachusetts" cat="place">Duxbury</a>  and vice chairman  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asgeir" cat="">Asgeir</a>  Fridgeirsson are insisting there will not be  <b>repercussions</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boleyn_Ground" cat="venue">Upton Park</a> . ''The position of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsbanki" cat="failure	banks">Landsbanki</a>  has absolutely no effect on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C." cat="club	winner">West Ham United</a>  and Mr  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GusGus" cat="group">Gudmundsson</a> 's ownership of the club. Mr  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GusGus" cat="group">Gudmundsson</a>  is an  <b>investor</b> with a large portfolio, of which  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsbanki" cat="failure	banks">Landsbanki</a>  was just part. He remains as committed as ever to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C." cat="club	winner">West Ham United</a>  and is not  <b>looking</b> to sell the club,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duxbury,_Massachusetts" cat="place">Duxbury</a>  said. The  <b>chief executive</b> also told the club's website: ''As has previously been stated, Mr  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GusGus" cat="group">Gudmundsson</a>  has invested ý40million net in the playing squad to create a squad capable of challenging in the top half of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League" cat="league	establishment">the Premier League</a> . ''Since his appointment,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianfranco_Zola" cat="person	player	manager	footballer	officer">Gianfranco Zola</a>  has made it quite clear that his first-team squad is too large and needs to be reduced so he can effectively  <b>coach</b> the team. Once this has happened and if the  <b>manager</b> requires further players, then the club will acquire them. ''Mr  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GusGus" cat="group">Gudmundsson</a>  remains  <b>fully</b> committed to the success of this  <b>football club</b> and building on the excellent start made by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianfranco_Zola" cat="person	player	manager	footballer	officer">Gianfranco Zola</a> .'' Singing from the same  <b>hymn</b> sheet, Fridgeirsson told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports" cat="establishment	division	channels">Sky Sports</a>  News: ''The government has claimed shares in the company which means that the government has claimed control. That means basically that we have lost it. I don't think there's any reason to be too  <b>pessimistic</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C." cat="club	winner">West Ham United</a>  is a wonderful club and a well-run company. This investment was very important for him, but not his only one. ''It is, of course, a blow for him and his financial strength, but he himself has a number of other investments that are doing quite well at the moment so there is no reason to fear that he will not honour his commitment to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham" cat="district">West Ham</a>   <b>football</b> club. ''He ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GusGus" cat="group">Gudmundsson</a> ) is not absolutely sure how this will directly affect him, but one thing he is sure of is that this will have no implications on the other investments of him and his family.'' In September the Hammers were left with a potential ý5million shortfall after the club's  <b>shirt sponsor</b>, XL, went  <b>bust</b>. Then, two weeks ago, an independent  <b>tribunal</b> ruled against the club in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Tévez" cat="">Carlos Tevez</a>  transfer affair, leaving them liable to a ý30million compensation claim. Although Fridgeirsson insists that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GusGus" cat="group">Gudmundsson</a>  has no plans to sell the club he did admit that several parties have expressed an interest in the club.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper" cat="periodical	product	newspaper	format">Newspaper</a>  reports last weekend suggested that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indians_by_net_worth" cat="billionaire">Indian billionaire</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Ambani" cat="billionaire	person	alumnus">Anil Ambani</a>  is poised to make a bid for the club and this speculation is likely to increase in the  <b>coming days</b> as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C." cat="club	winner">West Ham</a> 's situation become clearer. However, Ambani has been linked with several clubs in the last few weeks, including both  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" cat="port	district	place	city	post">Newcastle</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C." cat="club	member	winner">Everton</a> .
