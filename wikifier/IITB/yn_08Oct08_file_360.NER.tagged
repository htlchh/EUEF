LONDON (AFP)--Libya's energy chief called Tuesday on the world's oil producers to cut output to protect their incomes should crude prices continue to trade at current levels. "If the price level continues as it is we are seriously thinking of cutting down our production and calling on other member countries in OPEC, and non-OPEC producing countries, to cut their production to safeguard their incomes," Shukri Ghanem told AFP by telephone. "We are very much worried about this drop in the price," said Ghanem, who is Libya's representative in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. "We will think that all producing countries should take a unified view and should try to do something to stop the deterioration of prices," said Ghanem, who is also chairman of the Libyan National Oil Corporation. Crude futures rebounded by more than $2 a barrel Tuesday, holding close to $90 a barrel, on speculation that OPEC could cut output to prevent the market falling further. Traders said the market was also boosted by growing hopes that the world's central banks could cut their interest rates in a bid to boost troubled financial markets. The cost of crude oil has plummeted by about 40% since striking record heights above $147 a barrel in July, as the market has been dragged down by fears of weakening economic growth and slowing demand. Lower oil prices translate into falling revenues for members of the 13-nation OPEC cartel. Ghanem told AFP that he would support an emergency meeting of OPEC oil ministers to discuss the issue. "I will support the idea of an emergency meeting, but in the meantime we want to see action," he said. In September, OPEC decided to cut its production by 520,000 barrels a day to sustain oil prices above $100 a barrel. Ghanem's comments came one day after OPEC Vice President Galo Chiriboga, who is Ecuador's oil minister, said the volatile world financial markets could affect oil prices and force the cartel to take action.
