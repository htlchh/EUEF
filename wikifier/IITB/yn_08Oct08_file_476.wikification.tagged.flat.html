He said " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigerians</a>  expect the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly" cat="legislature">National Assembly</a> , in carrying out their oversight functions to at all  <b>times call</b> on the appropriate  <b>government agencies</b> for the mandatory disclosure of the payments made by oil, gas and mining companies to governments, and for governments to publicly reveal its revenues from these sectors so that citizens can hold them accountable for their management".
