If the new  <b>stem cells</b> can be used therapeutically, a simple  <b>testicular</b>  <b>biopsy</b> could provide the starting material for personalized  <b>regenerative medicine</b>.<br><br>The new  <b>stem cells</b>, known as  <b>human adult</b> germline  <b>stem cells</b> (GSCs), were grown by researchers in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" cat="state	republic	country	member	nation">Germany</a>  and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">U.K.</a>  by adding special  <b>growth factors</b> to spermatogonial  <b>cells</b> extracted from  <b>testes</b>. Spermatogonial  <b>cells</b> are  <b>stem</b>  <b>cells</b> in the adult  <b>testis</b> that normally generate only one type of differentiated cell (sperm). But with the right  <b>growth factors</b>, these spermatogonial  <b>cells</b> can change to become  <b>pluripotent</b>. They begin to produce  <b>proteins</b> normally made by  <b>embryonic stem cells</b> and acquire the ability to differentiate into many different  <b>cell</b> types.<br><br>In a paper published today in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)" cat="journal">Nature</a> , Thomas Skutella of the University of TÃ¼bingen, in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" cat="state	republic	country	member	nation">Germany</a> , and his colleagues raise the possibility that adult GSCs could overcome many of the  <b>hurdles</b> still facing alternative approaches.<br><br>Unlike  <b>embryonic stem cells</b>, which require the destruction of  <b>human embryos</b> and pose  <b>immunological</b> challenges because a patient's body will reject foreign  <b>cells</b>, adult GSCs do not require  <b>embryos</b> and should be tolerated by patients because they are made from their own  <b>cells</b>. Adult GSCs should also be more versatile than other types of  <b>adult stem cells</b>, which typically can only give rise to one or a few types of  <b>differentiated cells</b>.<br><br>Furthermore, in contrast with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), which are made by  <b>engineering</b>  <b>embryonic stem-cell</b>  <b>genes</b> into normal adult  <b>cells</b> with the help of  <b>retroviruses</b>, the adult GSCs do not require significant manipulations and therefore avoid the associated  <b>cancer</b> risks.<br><br>Skutella says that his results are similar to those from recent experiments performed on  <b>mice</b>, but that it was much trickier to isolate the right kind of  <b>cells</b> in humans. "You can use the power of  <b>genetics</b> to make  <b>transgenic mice</b> with green  <b>spermatogonia</b> to easily isolate these  <b>cells</b>," he says. "But for  <b>regenerative medicine</b>, it's essential to use the human system. We obviously cannot make  <b>transgenic</b> humans, so we had to go back to the roots of  <b>cell biology</b>, and try a mixture of things to isolate the  <b>stem cells</b>."<br><br>Using 22 testis-tissue  <b>samples</b> from men ages 17 to 81, the researchers isolated spermatogonial  <b>stem cells</b> with the help of  <b>magnetic</b> beads that physically pulled the right  <b>cells</b> out of the  <b>cell</b> mix. These beads were coated with an  <b>antibody</b> that recognizes a surface  <b>molecule</b> that is enriched on  <b>germline</b>  <b>cells</b>. The researchers followed this with two more rounds of purification: one that used culture-dish coatings that preferentially stick to  <b>germline</b>  <b>cells</b>, and a second one that used coatings that stick to somatic (nongermline) cells. <br><br><br><br>By adding leukemia inhibitory factor ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia_inhibitory_factor" cat="protein">LIF</a> )--a molecule that is normally used to keep  <b>embryonic stem cells</b> from differentiating--the team managed to transform the resulting spermatogonial  <b>stem cells</b> into  <b>stem cells</b> that much more closely resembled  <b>embryonic stem cells</b> and can form a similar variety of  <b>cell</b> types.<br><br>Skutella thinks that  <b>germ</b>  <b>stem cells</b> are fundamentally more amenable to reprogramming than  <b>cells</b> that do not participate in the  <b>germline</b> (the production of sperm or eggs). In support of this, a similar transformation into  <b>pluripotent</b>  <b>cells</b> had previously been observed with primordial germ cells--cells in the  <b>embryo</b> that later go on to form  <b>sperm</b> and  <b>egg</b> precursors. But obtaining these  <b>germ cells</b> requires destroying the  <b>embryo</b>, while the  <b>testicular</b> adult  <b>cells</b> do not face this issue. "The DNA of  <b>germ cells</b> is more open to manipulations, so they have advantages compared to other  <b>adult stem cells</b>," says Skutella.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piruz" cat="">Fari</a>  Izadyar, director of  <b>scientific development</b> for the  <b>germline</b>  <b>stem-cell</b> program at  <b>biotech company</b> PrimeGen, says that his team has also had promising results with getting human  <b>testicular</b>  <b>tissue</b> to differentiate into cardiac, brain, bone, and  <b>cartilage cells</b>, although the company has not yet published the data. "It has been difficult to produce consistent results without a steady supply of normal human  <b>testicular</b>  <b>tissue</b>," he says.<br><br>While the starting material is easy to obtain with small  <b>testicular</b>  <b>biopsies</b>, Skutella admits that his method of producing  <b>stable</b>  <b>pluripotent</b>  <b>germ</b>  <b>stem-cell</b> lines takes several months, and that this would  <b>need to</b> be sped up if the  <b>cells</b> are to be used therapeutically. "We are currently  <b>looking</b> to improve our enrichment procedure by finding more-specific  <b>cell surface molecules</b> which can be used to isolate the  <b>cells</b> more quickly in the future," he says.<br><br>Another open question is whether and how women might be able to benefit from the discovery. Skutella argues that at the very least, male germ stem cells could be used to treat women in much the same way that  <b>bone marrow</b> is used in cancer therapy: by finding a closely related male donor and treating the patient with  <b>immunosuppressants</b>, to prevent the body from rejecting the  <b>cells</b>.<br><br>But others are hopeful that similarly versatile  <b>stem cells</b> can be obtained from the  <b>female reproductive tract</b>. Antonin  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Bukovsky" cat="person	dissident	prisoner	expatriate	activist	writer	critic">Bukovsky</a>  of the University of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee" cat="seats	place	capital	city">Knoxville</a> , in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee" cat="state">Tennessee</a> , has previously found  <b>stem cells</b> on the surface of the  <b>ovary</b> and managed to differentiate them into  <b>neuronal cells</b>. "I think these  <b>cells</b> might hold very similar potential to the  <b>testicular</b> ones, and they would be just as easy to obtain," he says. "You would only have to brush the surface of the ovary, and we already know they still exist in women of advanced age."<br><br>
