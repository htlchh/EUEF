Crews conducting an aerial search late Wednesday spotted what turned out to be the wreckage in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inyo_National_Forest" cat="area	forest">Inyo National Forest</a>  near the  <b>town</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Lakes,_California" cat="city">Mammoth Lakes</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff_John" cat="child	ending">Sheriff John</a>  Anderson said. They confirmed around 11 p.m. that the  <b>tail number</b> found matched Fossett's single-engine  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AviaBellanca_Aircraft" cat="manufacturer	company">Bellanca</a>  plane, he said. Anderson said no human remains were found in the wreckage. “It's quite often if you don't find remains within a few days, because of animals, you'll find nothing at all,” Anderson said. Teams led by the  <b>sheriff</b>'s  <b>department</b> would continue the search for remains Thursday, while  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board" cat="investigator	accident	agency">the National Transportation Safety Board</a>  was en route to probe the cause of the crash, he said. Most of the plane's  <b>fuselage</b> disintegrated on impact, and the  <b>engine</b> was found several hundred  <b>feet</b> away at an elevation of 9,700  <b>feet</b>, authorities said. “It was a hard-impact crash, and he would've died instantly,” said Jeff Page,  <b>emergency management</b> coordinator for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_County,_Nevada" cat="county	establishment">Lyon County</a> , Nev., who assisted the search. After a  <b>hiker</b> found identification belonging to Fossett earlier in the week, searchers began combing the rugged terrain on Wednesday. The wreckage was found about a quarter-mile from where  <b>hiker</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_railway_station" cat="stations">Preston</a>  Morrow made his discovery Monday. The IDs provided the first possible clue about Fossett's  <b>whereabouts</b> since he disappeared Sept. 3, 2007, after taking off from a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada" cat="state	colony">Nevada</a>   <b>ranch</b> owned by hotel magnate  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron_Hilton" cat="sportspeople	person	socialite	member	billionaire	hotelier	owner	champion">Barron Hilton.</a>  “I remember the day he crashed, there were large  <b>thunderheads</b> over the peaks around us,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_County,_California" cat="county">Mono County</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undersheriff" cat="sheriff	title">Undersheriff</a>  Ralph Obenberger said, gesturing to the mountains flanking  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Lakes,_California" cat="city">Mammoth Lakes</a> . Aviators had previously  <b>flown</b> over  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Lakes,_California" cat="city">Mammoth Lakes</a> , about  <b>90 miles</b> south of the  <b>ranch</b>, in the search for Fossett, but it had not been considered a likely place to find the plane. The most  <b>intense</b> searching was concentrated north of the  <b>town</b>, given what searchers knew about sightings of Fossett's plane, his plans for when he had intended to return and the amount of fuel he had in the plane. A  <b>judge</b> declared Fossett, 63 when he disappeared, legally dead in February following a search for the famed  <b>aviator</b> that covered 20,000 square miles. Fossett made a fortune  <b>trading futures</b> and options on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" cat="place	settlement	community	city	seats">Chicago</a>  markets. He gained worldwide fame for more than 100 attempts and successes in setting records in  <b>high-tech</b>  <b>balloons</b>,  <b>gliders</b>, jets and boats. In  <b>2002</b>, he became the first person to circle the world solo in a  <b>balloon</b>.
