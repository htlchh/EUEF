It helps that the shows are dramas. We ruin dramas at a much less  <b>alarming</b> rate than  <b>comedies</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" cat="network	subsidiary	company">ABC</a> 's  <b>remake</b> of " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(U.S._TV_series)" cat="1970s	ending	portrayal	show">Life on Mars</a> " is surprisingly great, its  <b>pilot</b> living up to the lofty expectations of the original. Not many observers following the ill-fated path of this  <b>remake</b> would have put odds on " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(U.S._TV_series)" cat="1970s	ending	portrayal	show">Life on Mars</a> " being anything less than a full-fledged disaster.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._Kelley" cat="writer	alumnus	producer	person	winner	lawyer	protestant">David E. Kelley</a>  was supposed to  <b>remake</b> it, then agreed to leave the project, which was then almost completely revamped - rarely a good sign. Getting the tone just right was already the primary concern, never mind botched attempts to "reimagine" it or the need to recast it almost completely.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_and_behold" cat="redirects">Lo and behold</a> , against great odds, " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)" cat="ending	1970s">Life on Mars</a> " is a reason to set your  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder" cat="medium">DVR</a>  on Thursday nights beyond  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a> 's  <b>comedy</b> lineup. " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)" cat="ending	1970s">Life on Mars</a> " galvanized the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">Brits</a>  (and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">Americans</a> , too, when it was shown on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_America" cat="communications	channels	network">BBC America</a> ) because the premise was so intriguing. In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester" cat="district	city	place	establishment">Manchester</a>  in  <b>2006</b>, detective  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Tyler" cat="detective	person	character">Sam Tyler</a>  is following leads about a  <b>serial killer</b> when he's hit by a car and wakes up in  <b>1973</b>. With the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie" cat="person	winner	musician	artist	singer	actor	expatriate	producer">David Bowie</a>  title song as a  <b>starting point</b> and the show referencing all kinds of '70s images - clothes, music, attitudes - there were ample  <b>storytelling</b> hooks. Part  <b>science fiction</b> - did he really go back in time? - part police procedural, part mystery and even part one man's search for personal identity, " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)" cat="ending	1970s">Life on Mars</a> " ran for two seasons and 16 episodes in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" cat="country">England</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reset_(Torchwood)" cat="episode	story">Reset</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>  version is impressively loyal to the original as it switches out  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester" cat="district	city	place	establishment">Manchester</a>  for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" cat="area	capital	settlement	place	establishment	game	city">New York City</a> , but most important, it works on its own as an intriguing, exceptionally well-cast pilot.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people" cat="group	person">Irish</a>   <b>actor</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_O'Mara" cat="person	actor	parameter">Jason O'Mara</a>  (who has been in everything from " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Trees" cat="show	ending">Men in Trees</a> " to "The Closer" and " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey's_Anatomy" cat="show	winner">Grey's Anatomy</a> ") is the only cast member who survived  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" cat="network	subsidiary	company">ABC</a> 's revamping. He brings real appeal to the role of Sam (as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Simm" cat="person	actor">John Simm</a>  did in the original), convincingly being mystified, outraged and curious about his condition. He can't figure out whether he's in a  <b>coma</b>, dreaming it all or if he's  <b>truly</b> gone back in time 35 years. The great  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Keitel" cat="person	actor	alumnus	marines	jew">Harvey Keitel</a>  plays Lt.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hunt" cat="character	detective	person">Gene Hunt</a> , whose '70s-era beat-'em-up-and-plant-the-evidence ethos is a  <b>thorn</b> in Sam's side.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Imperioli" cat="actor	alumnus	person	winner">Michael Imperioli</a>  ("The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos" cat="show	winner	works	ending">Sopranos</a> ") is perfectly cast as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Carling" cat="character	detective	person">Ray Carling</a>  - all muttonchops, mustache and attitude - who will  <b>frequently</b> be at odds with Sam. Jonathan Murphy plays  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Skelton" cat="character	detective">Chris Skelton</a> , the more wide-eyed (and open-minded) young detective on the team, and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Mol" cat="actor	person">Gretchen Mol</a>  is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Cartwright" cat="character	detective	person">Annie Norris</a> , who as the only female officer endures the  <b>sexist</b> gibes of all those around her and is tabbed for little more than  <b>kitten</b> retrieval and calming down frantic female suspects. Sam confides in Annie his belief that he's a  <b>time-traveler</b> but also sees the  <b>psychological</b> smarts she's honing and tries to use her in solving cases when the others won't.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)" cat="musician	orphan	character	knight	archer	fighter">Link</a>  to present  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Bonet" cat="jew	actor	person">Lisa Bonet</a>  plays Maya, Sam's love interest and fellow  <b>detective</b> in  <b>2008</b>, who could be the latest victim of the  <b>serial killer</b> he was tracking before getting hit by the car. Less  <b>obviously</b>, she's the  <b>beneficiary</b> of the trail that Annie is blazing in the '70s. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(UK_TV_series)" cat="sitcom	ending	winner">British original</a>  was rife with delicious cultural references that went beyond the  <b>gold mine</b> that is the '70s. For example, the series reflected on whether Sam was having an  <b>existential crisis</b>, frequently referenced " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" cat="novel	film	musical	winner	book">The Wizard of Oz</a> " and made judicious jokes about  <b>technology</b>. (Here's hoping the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>  version uses the same restraint - one or two per episode at maximum.) No doubt  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" cat="network	subsidiary	company">ABC</a>  believed that " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)" cat="ending	1970s">Life on Mars</a> " was a perfect import because  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  (and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">America</a> ) in  <b>1973</b> held  <b>storytelling</b> arcs that went above and beyond the premise. They certainly  <b>nail</b> the  <b>pilot</b> -  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ó_Meadhra" cat="">O'Mara</a>  is wonderful,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Keitel" cat="general	nazi	person	marshals	personnel	recipient	leaders">Keitel</a>  comes on like a  <b>lion</b> and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Imperioli" cat="actor	alumnus	person	winner">Imperioli</a> , who was added late, could end up separating himself wonderfully from his "Sopranos" legacy, which is no easy feat. If " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)" cat="ending	1970s">Life on Mars</a> " even clears half the music used in the  <b>pilot</b> - the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie" cat="person	winner	musician	artist	singer	actor	expatriate	producer">Bowie</a>  cut was an essential  <b>lock</b> but there's also music from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who" cat="group	artist	winner	quartet">the Who</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones" cat="artist	holder	winner	group	stone	quartet	quintet	musician">the Rolling Stones</a>  - then the series will be off to a grand start. And yet - you knew this was coming - there are certain  <b>worries</b>. With only 16 episodes in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" cat="country">England</a>  successfully wrapping up Sam's journey, will stretching it out for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_the_United_States" cat="">American television</a>   <b>doom</b> it?  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" cat="network	subsidiary	company">ABC</a>  will want the network standard of 22 episodes for five seasons, at minimum. That may be asking for too much delayed audience gratification, but the  <b>pilot</b> does create a lot of room for  <b>optimism</b>. There should be no rush to reveal what Sam is really experiencing, and '70s  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  won't grow old quickly. If the ambition of the  <b>pilot</b> continues,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_the_United_States" cat="">American television</a>  may get  <b>another remake</b> right. We'll have our first hint this next week. In the meantime, enjoy the  <b>pilot</b>. Another  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">Brit</a>  import, this one run through the Jerry Bruckheimer/CBS school of procedurals, effortlessly improves the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>   <b>batting average</b>.

Not  <b>nearly</b> as ambitious as " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)" cat="ending	1970s">Life on Mars</a> " but entertaining nonetheless, " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Hour_(TV_series)" cat="">Eleventh Hour</a> " starts with an episode on cloning (there was talk that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" cat="owner	company	winner	establishment	network">CBS</a>  might shift the  <b>pilot</b> back in favor of something a little less shocking than manipulation of 19  <b>fetuses</b>).  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Sewell" cat="person	actor	translator	winner	member	parameter">Sewell</a>  portrays Dr. Hood as slightly offbeat but brilliant, and in constant danger because of what he knows.

" <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Hour_(TV_series)" cat="">Eleventh Hour</a> " seems less "CSI" than one man's using his smarts on cases that highlight the fringe factor of scientific and medical crimes. In fact, " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Hour_(TV_series)" cat="">Eleventh Hour</a> " is probably a better  <b>drama</b> than  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" cat="channels	network	subsidiary">Fox</a> 's "Fringe," sans all the cool graphics.
