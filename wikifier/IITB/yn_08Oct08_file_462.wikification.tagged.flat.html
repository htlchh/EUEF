The selection of the child  <b>goddess</b>, or Royal  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  , had for centuries required the approval of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepal</a> 's kings, but the abolition of the  <b>monarchy</b> earlier this year dictated a protocol change. "In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepal</a>  's changed political context,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" cat="president">President</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Baran_Yadav" cat="member	president	leaders	person	politician	expatriate">Ram Baran Yadav</a>  has taken the responsibility of approving the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  as he's now head of state," said Hemraj Subedi, an official on the board that selected the girl in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu" cat="place	capital">Kathmandu</a> . Three-year-old Matine  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakya" cat="words	peoples">Shakya</a>  was chosen to replace the current Royal  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a> , 12-year-old  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumari_(children)" cat="person	temple	dispute">Preeti Shakya</a> , because the  <b>older girl</b> is near  <b>puberty</b> after which she will be considered  <b>ritually</b> unclean. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism" cat="dispute">Maoist</a>  government has maintained the tradition of the "living goddesses" despite being officially  <b>atheist</b>. "Just because we are now a  <b>republic</b> and no longer have a king or royal  <b>priest</b>, does not mean we should end our traditions," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keshab" cat="place">Keshab</a>  Bahadur Shrestha, a member of the government's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  selection panel.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepal</a>  became the world's newest  <b>republic</b> after former rebel  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism" cat="dispute">Maoists</a>  ended their  <b>civil war</b> two years ago, won landmark polls in April and quickly pushed through the abolition of the world's last  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu" cat="">Hindu</a>   <b>monarchy</b>. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a> , which means virgin, must meet 32 strict criteria -- including having a "chest like a lion" and "thighs like a deer" -- as well as pass tests that include being in a room with dead sacrificed  <b>buffalo</b> and not crying. There are three  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumari_(children)" cat="person	temple	dispute">Kumaris</a>  in  <b>medieval towns</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu_Valley" cat="site">Kathmandu Valley</a>  , but the Royal  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  in Kathmandu is considered the most powerful and had the closest links with the former  <b>monarchy</b>. "The new  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  is undergoing special private rituals carried out by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu" cat="">Hindu</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" cat="dispute">Buddhist</a>  priests and will officially start on Tuesday," said Subedi. The Royal  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  used to stay locked up in an ornate  <b>palace</b> in the centre of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu" cat="place	capital">Kathmandu</a> 's  <b>old quarter</b>, and was only allowed out for a handful of festivals -- a practice challenged by  <b>human rights</b> lawyers in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepal</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  . In August, the court ruled the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  had the right to attend a school. "In the name of preserving  <b>culture</b>, the rights of the child should not be curtailed. There should be no compromise in her rights to play, study and grow,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  spokesman  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemant_Kanitkar" cat="person	cricketer">Hemant</a>  Rawal said Monday. However, it was unclear how much freedom the new  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  would have. The child, who has been in  <b>nursery school</b>, "will have to stay in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>   <b>palace</b> and be taught by  <b>tutors</b> once she becomes the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a> ," said Subedi of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  selection panel. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a> 's  <b>aura</b> is largely dependent on her separation from the  <b>outside world</b> and the people in charge of looking after her say they take orders from "the heavens." Until being deposed in May, ex- king  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanendra_of_Nepal" cat="pretender	marshals	person	dispute	recipient	crosse	ruler">Gyanendra</a>  , the last in his 240-year-old line, received blessings for his rule from the young girl chosen from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" cat="dispute">Buddhist</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakya" cat="words	peoples">Shakya</a>  community. His forefather,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithvi_Narayan_Shah" cat="person">Prithvi Narayan Shah</a>  , sought blessings from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu" cat="place	capital">Kathmandu</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar" cat="names	surname">Kumari</a>  when he conquered the capital in  <b>1768</b> and after that the  <b>goddess</b>'s blessing was seen as giving the royals spiritual approval of their reign.
