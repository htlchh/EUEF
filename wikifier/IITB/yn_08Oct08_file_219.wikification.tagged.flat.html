Fire and  <b>smoke</b> poured from the vehicle that crashed into a  <b>semi-truck</b> at Georgetown and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette,_Indiana" cat="seats	place	city">Lafayette</a>  last month.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Metropolitan_Police_Department" cat="agency	department">IMPD</a>  Officer  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeline" cat="orphan	book	film">Madeline</a>  Lothamer recalled the rescue that some are calling heroic. "I could hear a female calling, 'Help me! Help me!' I saw the shadow of her arm through the  <b>smoke</b>," Officer Lothamer said. "I believe she was in a state of shock. I truly believe she was unconscious." Cameras inside the  <b>police</b>  <b>cruisers</b> recorded five officers stopping at nothing to save the life of 27-year-old Sherica Lovett who was trapped in the driver's seat. "The intense amount of  <b>heat</b> and the  <b>smoke</b> billowing from the vehicle. It was very difficult for her to see,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Metropolitan_Police_Department" cat="agency	department">IMPD</a>  Officer Christopher  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilburn" cat="surname">Wilburn</a>  said. Police used  <b>fire extinguishers</b> to try to put out the flames, while one officer swung a baton and smashed the car's window. Officer Lothamer  <b>helped</b> pull the Lovett from the burning vehicle. Despite the  <b>heat</b> and  <b>smoke</b>, officers got Lovett out safely. "The goal was just to get her out quickly by whatever means it took," Lothamer said. On the tape, you can hear Lovett telling  <b>police</b> she's okay after they get her out of the  <b>still-burning</b> car. "I <b>'m</b> not injured, I <b>'m</b> not injured," she told the officers as they try to get her to relax. Police don't think Lovett realized just how  <b>badly</b> she was hurt. Officers knew the victim was burned. "All this time, she's uttering, 'I'm fine, I'm okay'," Lothamer said. "You could see the burns on both of her arms, because that was the only exposed  <b>skin</b> we could see at that time." Ninety seconds after the rescue, the vehicle exploded. "If it had not been for the heroic acts of these officers, she obviously would have been consumed inside of the vehicle,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilburn" cat="surname">Wilburn</a>  said. Lovett is now recovering in the  <b>burn center</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishard_Memorial_Hospital" cat="hospital	facility">Wishard Hospital</a> . Her mother has been at her bedside since the accident, saying she's very  <b>grateful</b> to the five officers who risked their own lives to save her daughter.
