Wrapped in red  <b>silk</b> and adorned with red flowers in her hair,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matani" cat="place">Matani</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakya" cat="words	peoples">Shakya</a>  received approval from the priests and President  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Baran_Yadav" cat="member	president	leaders	person	politician	expatriate">Ram Baran Yadav</a>  in a centuries-old tradition with deep ties to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepal</a> 's  <b>monarchy</b>, which was abolished in May. The new "kumari" or living goddess, was carried from her parents' home to an ancient palatial  <b>temple</b> in the heart of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language" cat="language">Nepali</a>  capital,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu" cat="place	capital">Katmandu</a>  , where she will live until she reaches  <b>puberty</b> and loses her divine status. She will be worshipped by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu" cat="">Hindus</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buddhists" cat="list">Buddhists</a>  as an incarnation of the powerful  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_deities" cat="deity">Hindu deity</a>  Taleju. A panel of judges conducted a series of ancient ceremonies to select the  <b>goddess</b> from several 2- to 4-year-old girls who are all members of the impoverished  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakya" cat="words	peoples">Shakya</a>   <b>goldsmith</b>  <b>caste</b>. The judges read the candidates' horoscopes and check each one for physical imperfections. The  <b>living goddess</b> must have  <b>perfect hair</b>, eyes,  <b>teeth</b> and  <b>skin</b> with no scars, and should not be afraid of the dark. As a final test, the  <b>living goddess</b> must spend a night alone in a room among the heads of  <b>ritually slaughtered</b>  <b>goats</b> and  <b>buffaloes</b> without showing fear. Having passed all the tests, the child will stay in almost complete isolation at the temple, and will be allowed to return to her family only at the onset of  <b>menstruation</b> when a new  <b>goddess</b> will be named to replace her. "I feel a bit sad, but since my child has become a  <b>living goddess</b> I feel proud," said her father Pratap Man  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakya" cat="words	peoples">Shakya</a> . During her time as a  <b>goddess</b>, she will always wear red, pin up her hair in  <b>topknots</b>, and have a "third eye" painted on her  <b>forehead</b>. Devotees touch the girls' feet with their foreheads, the highest sign of respect among  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu" cat="">Hindus</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepal</a>  . During religious festivals the goddesses are wheeled around on a  <b>chariot</b> pulled by devotees. Critics say the tradition violates both international and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepalese</a>  laws on  <b>child rights</b>. The girls often struggle to  <b>readjust</b> to normal lives after they return home.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal" cat="country	monarchy	state	republic">Nepalese</a>   <b>folklore</b> holds that men who marry a former kumari will die young, and so many girls remain unmarried and face a life of hardship.
