Later Tuesday, while standing with the president and  <b>prime minister</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a> , Gates said that in meetings with the leaders he reaffirmed the pledge that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">President Bush</a>  made  <b>—</b> that "we came in together and we will go out together." He said they talked about maintaining the current troop levels, and said the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  is focused on providing services, equipment and training for the new  <b>ministry</b> and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Security_Force" cat="">Kosovo security forces</a> . Gates added that there also is funding in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon" cat="landmark	facility	building">the Pentagon</a> 's  <b>2009</b> budget for  <b>military education and training</b> programs for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a> , although he was not sure what specifically would be provided for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a> . He added that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  looks "forward to the day when peace is self-sustaining." Gates' visit marked the first time a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Cabinet" cat="cabinet">U.S. Cabinet</a>  member has been to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a>  since the country declared its  <b>independence</b> in February. And it underscored the escalating tensions between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" cat="alliance	treaty	organization	supraorganizations	organisation	relations">NATO</a>  allies and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow" cat="city	list	establishment	capital">Moscow</a>  as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe" cat="region">Eastern European</a>  nations increasingly look to the West.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatmir_Sejdiu" cat="president	albanian	person">President Fatmir Sejdiu</a>  said that while fewer than 50 nations have recognized  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a>   <b>—</b> just half of the country's goal  <b>—</b> he believes that other countries, including  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia" cat="state	country">Macedonia</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro" cat="state	site	republic	country">Montenegro</a> , have given him "positive signals." Earlier, Gates said his main goal on this trip was to meet with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  troops serving in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a>  as part of  <b>coalition</b> of more than 30 nations, with a force of roughly 15,000. There currently are about 1,600  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  troops in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a> . The last time a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense" cat="establishment	secretary">U.S. defense secretary</a>  was here was  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld" cat="officer	executive	candidate	person	member	representative	alumnus	science	secretary	scout	chief	aviator	presbyterian	businesspeople">Donald Rumsfeld</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2001" cat="">June 2001</a> . At that time,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" cat="alliance	treaty	organization	supraorganizations	organisation	relations">NATO</a>   <b>peacekeepers</b> were struggling to halt the flow of weapons across the border into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Macedonia" cat="state	country">Macedonia</a> . Soldiers watched for  <b>mule</b> trains hauling the supplies across the border to aid  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians" cat="group	person	peoples	community">Ethnic Albanian</a>  rebels who were fighting the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_Republic_of_Macedonia" cat="politics">Macedonian government</a> . This time the struggle is more political. Gates' visit coincides with an expected legal battle over  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a> 's  <b>independence</b>, as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia" cat="country	site	republic	state">Serbia</a>  seeks a ruling from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice" cat="organisation	establishment">International Court of Justice</a>  on the fledgling nation's legality. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  and most  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_State_of_the_European_Union" cat="">European Union nations</a>  have recognized  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a> 's  <b>independence</b>, but others worry that such acceptance could  <b>energize</b> other  <b>separatist</b> movements such as those in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" cat="member	state	country">Spain</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(historical_territory)" cat="">Basque region</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia" cat="country	site	republic	state">Serbia</a>  considers  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a>  its religious and historic heartland and, along with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a> , has rejected the declaration. The conflict is one of several that have led to growing discord between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a>  and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  and many  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" cat="alliance	treaty	organization	supraorganizations	organisation	relations">NATO</a>  allies. But relations plunged in August when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a>  invaded its smaller neighbor, the former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union" cat="list	country	subdivision">Soviet republic</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)" cat="country	republic	state">Georgia</a> . Gates has urged calm in the wake of the brief  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia–Georgia_war" cat="">Russia-Georgia war</a>  that enraged  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" cat="concept">Europe</a>  and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S. A</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a>  expert who formerly led  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" cat="agency">the CIA</a> , Gates has said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow" cat="city	list	establishment	capital">Moscow</a>  is not seeking global dominance, but instead is  <b>looking</b> to "exorcise past humiliations" and recapture its glory days. As he headed for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" cat="subdivision	dispute	territory	state">Kosovo</a> , Gates said it is not productive to make broad pronouncements that various ties with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a>  be severed. Instead, he said, "we have to figure out the right path in terms of the reality that we have to do business with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a>  on important issues, but at the same time, to convey the message that it can't be business as usual after what happened in Georgia."  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" cat="record	economics">Copyright</a>   <b>2008</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" cat="cooperative	agency	establishment	medium	recipient">The Associated Press</a> .
