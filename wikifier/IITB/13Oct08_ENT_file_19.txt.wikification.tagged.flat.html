Such omnibus pictures are almost always mixed bags by their very design.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer" cat="occupation	producer">Producers</a>  especially like the  <b>triptych</b> related to a theme or  <b>genre</b> with the  <b>usual</b> result being  <b>mediocrities</b> like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_(mythology)" cat="">Eros</a>  (about love/lust) or Three…Extremes (horror). One  <b>director</b> might manage to make something special, but more often than not, the other stories turn out to be slogs, bringing down the whole enterprise.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" cat="place	game	city	capital	settlement	prefecture">Tokyo</a> !, in lineage with (the yes, middling)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stories" cat="film">New York Stories</a> , however actually manages the exceedingly rare accomplishment of getting all three of its episodes right.<br><br>First up is Michel Gondry’s funny, warm “Interior Design.” Young filmmaker  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(film)" cat="film">Akira</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryō_Kase" cat="">Ryo Kase</a> ) and his girlfriend Hiroko ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayako_Fujitani" cat="person	actor	jew">Ayako Fujitani</a> ) come to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" cat="place	game	city	capital	settlement	prefecture">Tokyo</a>  to make a new life for themselves. They stay in the absurdly small  <b>apartment</b> (a necessary joke) of friend Akemi ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayumi_Ito" cat="person	actor">Ayumi Ito</a> ) while looking for work and a new place to live.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(film)" cat="film">Akira</a>  starts to find a niche, but Hiroko feels rudderless, like she doesn’t even belong on the  <b>planet</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="planet">Earth</a> . That is, until she undergoes a highly peculiar  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka" cat="novelist	person	anarchist	jew	writer	diarist	alumnus	socialist">Kafkesque</a>  transformation.<br><br>Like in many an  <b>anime</b>, Gondry’s characters are cute, spunky, and innocent. Actress  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitani" cat="">Fujitani</a> , who up to this point is best known for starring in a series of movies about giant  <b>turtle</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamera" cat="turtle	film	superheroes	character	mutant">Gamera</a> , is a pure delight here. Gondry evades his biggest  <b>weaknesses</b> by refusing overindulgence or letting his flights of fancy usurp the story. The Debussy-like music by Etienne Charry is an ideal compliment to the moods Gondry sets. “Interior Design” is slight yet perfect. However, no doubt some  <b>feminist</b>  <b>film</b> student is going to erroneously generalize Hiroko’s predilections to all women and blast the movie for it at some point.<br><br>Next, we get “Merde” by one-time enfant terrible  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leos_Carax" cat="filmmaker	director	person">Leos Carax</a> , returning to  <b>film</b> for the first time since 1999’s provocative  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pula" cat="city	colony	place	town	dispute">Pola</a>  X. A pseudo-spoof of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiju" cat="terms	words">Japanese monster</a>  movies, “Merde” opens with “The Creature from the Sewers” (the perfectly cast  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Lavant" cat="person	actor	parameter">Denis Lavant</a> ) terrorizing the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" cat="place	game	city	capital	settlement	prefecture">Tokyo</a>  populace to Akira Ifukube’s classic  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla" cat="character	dinosaur	mutant	monster	king	superheroes	creature">Godzilla</a>  score. The creature, looking like a lanky disfigured  <b>leprechaun</b>, is finally captured and put on trial. Lucky for the creature, one of the three people on the  <b>planet</b> who can speak his  <b>language</b> is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" cat="language">French</a>   <b>attorney</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woland" cat="character	demon">Voland</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-François_Balmer" cat="">Jean-Francois Balmer</a> ), introduced to us brandishing a decapitated cat’s head in the  <b>court room</b>.<br><br>One of the main jokes in the movie is the creature’s bizarre language. Ironically it sounds a bit like a mixture between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language" cat="language">Japanese</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh" cat="dance	style">Noh</a>  on speed and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_opera" cat="">Chinese opera</a>  while incorporating physical gestures like face slapping and  <b>tooth</b>  <b>poking</b>. The audacity of the joke is in the brazen length at which  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leos_Carax" cat="filmmaker	director	person">Carax</a>  keeps it going. It’s helped by Lavant throwing himself into the role whole hog. “Merde” might sound like a broad  <b>comedy</b> but  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leos_Carax" cat="filmmaker	director	person">Carax</a> , as usual, is aiming for something more inscrutable, and he gets it. How pleasurable an audience will find all this though is likely to vary in the extreme. I enjoyed it.<br><br>The final installment is Bong Joon-ho’s “Shaking  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" cat="place	game	city	capital	settlement	prefecture">Tokyo</a> ,” about a  <b>hikikomori</b>, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language" cat="language">Japanese</a>  term for someone who seeks extreme isolation from others. Our unnamed protagonist ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teruyuki_Kagawa" cat="person	actor	recipient">Teruyuki Kagawa</a> ) lives in his  <b>poorly</b> lit, carefully arranged home. His  <b>obsessive-compulsive disorder</b> has raised  <b>tidiness</b> to the level of art as he keeps  <b>toilet paper</b> rolls and old  <b>pizza boxes</b> lined up against the walls like a proud CD collection. He survives on money his father sends him and orders everything he needs over the  <b>telephone</b>. He never looks at the people that deliver his food until one day he makes  <b>eye contact</b> for the first time in 11 years with another  <b>human being</b>, a pizza delivery girl ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yū_Aoi" cat="">Yu Aoi</a> ) who has arrived just as an  <b>earthquake</b> begins. Of course he falls in love.<br><br>The story sounds trite, but the experience lies in Bong’s  <b>truly</b>  <b>outstanding direction</b> and how he brilliantly conveys the interior  <b>state</b> of his  <b>protagonist</b> - the way he opens his front door to go outside feels like he’s entering a lion’s cage, the blinding contrast in the image magnifying his sense of  <b>disorientation</b> once he is outside, how another human figure does a  <b>slow fade</b> from behind a piece of  <b>glass</b>. Bong does get too cute with  <b>tattoos</b> of buttons on the girl’s body that actually do what’s labeled on the  <b>tattoo</b> when pushed. Aside from this misstep, Bong carefully modulates his film’s different  <b>moods</b> until it swirls into a soaring  <b>inimitable</b>  <b>symphony</b> of emotions.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yū_Aoi" cat="">Yu Aoi</a> , who despite her youth has appeared in some of the most noteworthy  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Japan" cat="">Japanese films</a>  this decade ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmful_Insect" cat="film">Harmful Insect</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_About_Lily_Chou-Chou" cat="film">All About Lily Chou-Chou</a> , and Hanna and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_(TV_series)" cat="sitcom	ending	program	show	winner">Alice</a> ), retains her  <b>usual</b> alluring presence.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoto_Takenaka" cat="person	comedian	director	actor	parameter	singer	impressionist">Naoto Takenaka</a>  makes a brief but uproarious appearance playing her aggressive,  <b>intrusive</b>  <b>boss</b>.<br><br>In comparing the different segments, “Interior Design” and “Shaking Tokyo” are both  <b>superb</b>. Making an  <b>analogy</b> to  <b>gymnastics</b> or  <b>diving</b>, Gondry doesn’t go for quite as high a  <b>difficulty level</b> as Bong, but he nails it while Bong comes exhilaratingly close to fulfilling his greater ambition. “Merde” is the weakest, but only  <b>relatively speaking</b>. It is so distinctive a work that I fervently hope  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leos_Carax" cat="filmmaker	director	person">Carax</a>  doesn’t take another nine years off. With “Shaking  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" cat="place	game	city	capital	settlement	prefecture">Tokyo</a> ,” Bong is proving to be the most exciting and diverse  <b>filmmaker</b> out of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" cat="country	republic	state	region	nation">South Korea</a>  in recent years, and that’s saying a lot when you’re talking about the  <b>likes</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Chang-dong" cat="person	director">Lee Chang-dong</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chan-wook" cat="alumnus	director	screenwriter	person	critic	producer">Park Chan-wook</a> , and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Sang-soo" cat="person	alumnus	academic	screenwriter	director">Hong Sang-soo</a> .<br><br>George Wu<br>
