 The  <b>incredible</b> career of  <b>adventure</b>  <b>cameraman</b> Keith Partridge By Samantha Booth ADVENTURE filming is  <b>cameraman</b> Keith Partridge's  <b>bread</b> and  <b>butter</b>. In the last  <b>18 months</b>, he has scaled an ice-covered  <b>mountain</b> with ex-footballer  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright" cat="footballer	commentator	player	personality	person	presenter	topscorers	member">Ian Wright</a> , climbed down an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaskan</a>   <b>snow hole</b>, conquered the  <b>terrifying</b> north face of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiger" cat="mountain	three">the Eiger</a> , explored unchartered  <b>water</b>  <b>caves</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" cat="country	state	member">Papua New Guinea</a>  and hunted down the most venomous spiders, snakes and bugs in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Rainforest" cat="region	ecoregions">Brazilian rainforest</a> . He has coped with  <b>blizzards</b>,  <b>tropical storms</b>, temperatures well below zero, 1000ft climbs up sheer  <b>rock</b> faces and the most basic  <b>camping</b> conditions imaginable. And Keith has done it all with a  <b>camera</b> in his hand and a pack full of photographic kit on his back. The results have been watched by millions around the world in such  <b>documentaries</b> as The History of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change" cat="problem">Climate Change</a> , Venom Hunter,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_(band)" cat="group	quartet">Extreme</a>  Dreams,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Land_of_the_Jaguar" cat="">Lost Land Of The Jaguar</a>  and even  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_(current_format)" cat="">Top Gear</a> . He has also worked on films such as the multi-award winning  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touching_the_Void" cat="book">Touching The Void</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Hollywood</a>   <b>sci-fi</b> flick  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_vs._Predator" cat="list">Alien Vs Predator</a> . But while viewers marvel at the amazing scenes of sunrises turning  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic" cat="loanword">Arctic</a>  snows pink, the magical icy  <b>blue world</b> hidden beneath  <b>glaciers</b> and the  <b>insides</b> of treacherous  <b>caves</b> never before seen by man, it's not often anyone thinks about how these  <b>incredible</b> pictures are brought to our  <b>television</b> screens. But now we can meet the man behind the images, and unbelievably the 42-year-old shrugs off any suggestion that what he does for a living is dangerous. Keith, who lives in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Largo" cat="village	attraction">Lower Largo</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife" cat="area	county">Fife</a> , with his wife, Andrea, and children, Jamie, four, and Erin, 16 months, said: "It isn't dangerous because we all know what we are doing and we take every  <b>safety</b> precaution imaginable. "When we do these films, we have fantastic teams of experts and everything is checked and double checked so we eliminate as much risk as possible." But to the outside observer, Keith's work looks about as far removed from asafe office job as possible. In one picture of him filming for a  <b>documentary</b> called Beckoning Silence:  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_North_Face" cat="brand	company	manufacturer">North Face</a>  Of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiger" cat="mountain	three">The Eiger</a> , in which the team recreated a tragic  <b>1936</b> expedition on which four  <b>climbers</b> died, Keith is balancing on the sheer  <b>rock face</b> on the tips of his boots as he films the action. In another still of Keith working on the same programme, he is suspended  <b>thousands</b> of  <b>feet</b> up with one foot on a rock the size of a  <b>house brick</b> for stability. And when he had finished a day's filming on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiger" cat="mountain	three">the Eiger</a> , Keith had to unclip himself from his  <b>safety rope</b>, leaving himself momentarily unharnessed on the side of the  <b>mountain</b>, before grabbing a line dangling from a waiting  <b>helicopter</b>, the  <b>rotors</b> of which are spinning just  <b>metres</b> from the  <b>rock face</b>. He was then plucked from the  <b>mountain</b> and flown back to base camp while hanging below the  <b>chopper</b>. Just another day in the office for Keith. When filming in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a> , he found himself in a  <b>rubber dinghy</b> just eight  <b>feet</b> from a dozen 30-ton  <b>humpback</b> whales as they rose to the surface. That night, his riverside camp was visited by three hungry  <b>grizzly bears</b>. And on the same trip, he had to lower himself into an ice hole, known as a  <b>moulin</b>. Up to 400ft deep, they can go all the way to the bottom of a  <b>glacier</b>. Keith said: "Moulins are becoming more prevalent due to the melting of the  <b>ice caps</b>. But nobody goes into them because they are pretty scary places. "They are formed by rivers of melted  <b>water</b> flowing over the  <b>glacier</b> and drilling holes in the ice whenever they find weak spots. They are really intimidating and are not places to  <b>muck</b> about it in. But doing what I do is challenging and that's one of the reasons I love it. "And although we take as many precautions as possible, you never know what's going to happen. It has given me some amazing experiences. "One thing I have learned is that it's never over until it's over." One example was when Keith was in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" cat="state	nation	country	colony">Venezuela</a>  last year filming  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Land_of_the_Jaguar" cat="">Lost Land Of The Jaguar</a>  with  <b>adventurer</b> Chris Backshall and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">British</a>  climber John  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Arran" cat="volcano">Arran</a> . They were there to scale a 1000ft  <b>rock face</b>, which had never been climbed before. Hampered by overhanging rocks, even John struggled to find a route. It took the team four days to complete the climb, sleeping in cots suspended from the  <b>rock face</b>. At one  <b>particularly</b> difficult point, Steve lost his grip and was only saved from  <b>certain death</b> by his  <b>safety</b> ropes. And all the while Keith was one step ahead with his  <b>camera</b> to catch all the action. Once at the top, they figured the hardest part of the trip was over. Back at  <b>base camp</b>, they relaxed by playing  <b>football</b> with the locals until their plane arrived. Keith said: "A cool  <b>pint</b> of  <b>lager</b> was almost in sight, but then the plane took a nose-dive into the  <b>runway</b>. "We patched it up with  <b>gaffer tape</b> and filled it full of our gear. "But we then had to wait for a second plane to pick us up as we weren't confident enough about the plane to fly any of the team in it. "The second plane had to race an  <b>incoming</b> storm to pick us up and we only just made it out. "As I said, on these kind of adventures it really isn't over until it's over." KEITH didn't grow up dreaming of one day becoming an  <b>adventure</b>  <b>cameraman</b>. As a youngster in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich" cat="city	town	district">Norwich</a> , he and his friend actually went into business at the tender ago of 14 running a  <b>mobile disco</b>. He said: "I was into  <b>electronics</b> and it was just really something to do. "But incredibly it really took off and a few years later we were making quite a success of it." Then one day Keith chanced upon a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" cat="member	company	introduction	establishment	broadcaster	brand">BBC</a>   <b>advert</b> for technical operators. He said: "The ad said if you were interested in this and that, then apply. "I seemed to  <b>tick</b> all the boxes so I did and got accepted. It was great because they trained you in everything." In his spare time, Keith was a keen climber and, after a couple of years with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" cat="member	company	introduction	establishment	broadcaster	brand">BBC</a> , he started to wonder if he could earn a living by combining everything he had learned about filming with his love of mountains. He spotted another  <b>advert</b>, this time placed by a guy looking for someone to go climbing in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland" cat="state	country	member	republic	colony">Iceland</a>  with him for a few weeks, and Keith's life was changed forever. Inspired by his trip, he left his secure job at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" cat="member	company	introduction	establishment	broadcaster	brand">BBC</a>  to become a  <b>freelance</b>  <b>adventure</b>  <b>cameraman</b>. In no time at all, he had his first commission, which just happened to be a  <b>documentary</b> with legendary  <b>climber</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bonington" cat="player	summiters	person	officer	climber	commander	president	gowers">Chris Bonington</a>  in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas" cat="division	words">Himalayas</a> . When he returned, he got another job filming award-winning  <b>documentary</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge" cat="winner	person	christian	guitarist	musician	member	singer">The Edge</a>  about 100 years of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" cat="country	nation">Scottish</a>   <b>mountaineering</b>, and then  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_rescue" cat="mountain">Mountain Rescue</a> : Inside Story for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One" cat="stations	channels">BBC1</a> . In the next few years, the work just kept rolling in. Keith filmed on Don't Try This At Home, Wilderness Walks and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Face_(magazine)" cat="magazine">The Face</a> , which involved climbing in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan" cat="country	state">Jordan</a>  with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin" cat="group	nomad	words">Bedouin</a> ,  <b>ice-climbing</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">America</a>  and scaling sea cliffs in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Hebrides" cat="region	area	colony">the Outer Hebrides</a> . He also worked on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_man" cat="character	explorer	men">Mountain Men</a> , K2,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longest_Journey" cat="game">The Longest Journey</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arctic_Challenge" cat="festival	competition	record">Arctic Challenge</a> . He even filmed the  <b>stunt</b> sequences in 2004's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Hollywood</a>  movie  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_vs._Predator" cat="list">Alien vs Predator</a> . Keith said: "That was quite an evening when a  <b>fax</b> arrived from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" cat="subsidiary	company	studio	distributor	recipient">20th Century Fox</a>  in our home in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Largo" cat="village	attraction">Lower Largo</a> ." But maybe Keith's most prestigious filming job has been for the multi-award winning movie  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_intimacy" cat="relationship">Touching</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Void_(The_Three_Worlds)" cat="">The Void</a> . Directed by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Macdonald_(director)" cat="filmmaker	director	person	parameter">Kevin MacDonald</a>  and based on the book by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Simpson_(mountaineer)" cat="person	speaker	winner	legend	climber">Joe Simpson</a> , it told the true story of two young  <b>climbers</b>, one of whom was Joe, and their  <b>perilous</b> journey up the west face of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siula_Grande" cat="mountain">Siula Grande</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru" cat="colony	country	republic	state	nation">Peru</a> . After three days of climbing, Joe fell, breaking several bones. His climbing partner,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Yates_(mountaineer)" cat="person	climber">Simon Yates</a> , attempted to get him back down the  <b>mountain</b> by lowering him on ropes. But when Joe became  <b>stuck</b> below an  <b>overhanging cliff</b>, Simon assumed his friend was dead and made the agonising decision to cut the  <b>rope</b> which connected them. Joe plunged into a  <b>crevasse</b> but amazingly survived and, even more amazingly, was able to crawl back to their  <b>base camp</b>, despite being in terrible  <b>pain</b>. Touching The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(comics)" cat="character	superheroes">Void</a>  is the story of Joe and Simon's separate journeys down the  <b>mountain</b>. The  <b>film</b>, shot on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siula_Grande" cat="mountain">Siula Grande</a>  as well as in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" cat="nation	country	state	republic	member">France</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" cat="country	state">Switzerland</a>  by Keith and his team in dreadful weather, won several awards, was nominated for even more and became a surprise box-office hit. Keith said: "We had a great time filming  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touching_the_Void" cat="book">Touching The Void</a>  despite some challenging conditions, but nobody had any idea the  <b>film</b> would be such a success. "Obviously, the audience knew Joe had survived because he was being interviewed in the  <b>film</b> but, as the story unfolds, they just watch in  <b>horror</b> as disaster after disaster unfolds. "What happens is almost impossible to believe and the  <b>film</b> makes viewers wonder about what would they do in the same circumstances." On a more personal level, a career highlight for Keith came this summer when he filmed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter" cat="child">Blue Peter</a> 's expedition. He is not allowed to disclose the location as the  <b>film</b> has yet to be shown. But what Keith can reveal is that his  <b>hard work</b> won him a much-coveted  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter_badge" cat="award">Blue Peter badge</a> . He said: "Yes, I finally got my  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter_badge" cat="award">Blue Peter badge</a> . "I grew up with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Peter" cat="child">Blue Peter</a> , so to work on the programme was an amazing experience for me and to get the badge was a big a thrill."
