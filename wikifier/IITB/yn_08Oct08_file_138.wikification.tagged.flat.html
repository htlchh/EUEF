We used  <b>photocopy</b> machines, print magazines and  <b>academic journals</b> almost exclusively. That time in the world's history is now gone forever. When  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin" cat="person	member	writer	contestant	candidate	politician	analyst	convert	republican	councillor	woman	nominee	broadcaster	pundit	governor	announcer	evangelicals	mayor">Sarah Palin</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden" cat="person	president	politician	player	candidate	senator	democrat	lawyer	recipient	scholar">Joe Biden</a>  debated in front of one of the largest TV audiences in US election history last week, the two candidates might not have been  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_(verb)" cat="">Googling</a>  for facts during the debate, but millions of people watching the debate were. Today about what kinds of things viewers were searching for as that debate unfolded, minute by minute. It is amazing both that viewers were able to do such a thing, in  <b>real time</b>, and that we're able to watch what people are searching for. The  <b>internet</b> in general, and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" cat="company	provider	website	establishment	property">Google</a>  in particular, has substantially augmented this important part of public life. The collective search history provides an interesting look at the world's reaction to what the candidates are saying.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" cat="company	provider	website	establishment	property">Google</a>  points out, for example, that one of the hottest searches of the night was "define:maverick." I wouldn't mind learning more about the word  <b>maverick</b> myself but I <b>'m</b> struck by the evidence that so many people know the search protocol define: and are comfortable using it in a dynamic situation! Other interesting, popular search queries mentioned in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" cat="company	provider	website	establishment	property">Google</a> 's  <b>blog</b> post today included: meaning of theocracy windfall profits tax nucular vs nuclear, nuclear pronunciation, palin  <b>nucular</b>, and even nukular "When  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" cat="house">Senator</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden" cat="person	president	politician	player	candidate	senator	democrat	lawyer	recipient	scholar">Biden</a>  offered a civics lesson (" <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution" cat="">Article I of the Constitution</a>  defines the role of the  <b>vice president</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a> , that's the Executive Branch") many people checked, and learned that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution" cat="">Article I of the Constitution</a>  describes the  <b>legislative branch</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" cat="establishment">the U.S. government</a> . The  <b>executive branch</b> is described in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution" cat="">Article II</a> . Others just searched directly for the role of  <b>vice president</b> and  <b>vice president</b> duties." It's pretty  <b>incredible</b> to know that these topics resonated enough with the public that they sought to learn more about them online. That people were even curious enough to ask is encouraging (at least for someone hoping the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrats</a>  will win). Another  <b>technology</b> that changed the debate experience was , which we wrote about  <b>immediately</b> after the first  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_debates" cat="">Presidential debate</a> . The candidates may not have used  <b>online search</b> while they were  <b>debating</b>, but we sure hope they will every day they are in office. It's changed fundamentally our relationship with  <b>politics</b> and we hope that politicians can keep up. Maybe they can even take the lead.

It's not  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" cat="company	provider	website	establishment	property">Google</a>  that changed the debate (or rather our ability to fact check it instantly), but rather the web.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" cat="company	provider	website	establishment	property">Google</a>  just happens to be the company that currently provides us the best gateway to get to that information. I would  <b>wager</b> that many of those searches landed people at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" cat="project	community	website	property">Wikipedia</a>  pages. In other words,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" cat="project	community	website	property">Wikipedia</a>  is probably changing the debate as much as many other sites. It's the collective power of the now ubiquitous web that is changing things. Posted by: | I'm always of two minds about this sorta thing. (Ok, those of you who just thought, " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)" cat="document">Usually</a>  of two minds most of the time", there's  <b>champagne</b> being served in the lobby. *Not!*) So long as the  <b>numb-nuts</b> stay clumsy this sort of tech won't be used for arcane evil.

We're talking fundamentals.

For e.g. at some point someone noticed that  <b>racist</b> policies interfered with  <b>profit</b> making. It's just plain bad for business (once you emancipate the  <b>slaves</b>, that is). When folk aren't playing with a  <b>stacked deck</b> (or a set of  <b>sophistic</b>  <b>talking points</b>) then they start to actually ponder  <b>social justice</b> as win/win ... which would be a major step. (E.g.: cheaper to give  <b>homeless</b>  <b>folk</b> apartments than to  <b>shell</b> out for endless  <b>stream</b> of  <b>emergency services</b>. And yes, I know how  <b>mercenary</b> that starts.)
