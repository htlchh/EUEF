Chris said: I cant wait to get to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Paz" cat="place	capital">La Paz</a>  and start working with the  <b>shoe shine boys</b>. The project will be both challenging and rewarding. And, Im sure to come back with new skills and some really useful experiences which will contribute to the work of the arts development team at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen" cat="community	city	area">Aberdeen City</a>  Council. Chris is a  <b>volunteer</b> with Creative Corners, a not for profit  <b>volunteer organisation</b> that specialises in creative projects for creative people: matching people to projects to which they are best suited and returning profits to communities that need them most.
