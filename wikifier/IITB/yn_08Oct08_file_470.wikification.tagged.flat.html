Representatives of 34  <b>international oil companies</b> will meet with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Iraq" cat="politics">Iraqi government</a>  officials in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" cat="capital	port	city	place">London</a>  on Monday to discuss the bidding process for eight  <b>enormous</b>  <b>oil</b> and  <b>gas</b> fields. If the contracts are approved, they could lead to the biggest foreign stake in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  since the industry was  <b>nationalized</b> more than 30 years ago. About 4,000 miles from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad" cat="capital	community	place	establishment">Baghdad</a> ,  <b>oil companies</b> are doing  <b>damage control</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>   <b>—</b> arguably the most dangerous place in the world where firms like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell" cat="company	dispute	brand	contractor">Royal Dutch Shell</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil" cat="scandal	company	contractor	brand">Exxon Mobil</a>  currently operate. Three years of attacks in the country's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta" cat="disaster	accident	ecoregions	landforms">Niger Delta</a>  have cut  <b>oil</b> production from  <b>2.5</b> million  <b>barrels</b> per day to around 1.5 million  <b>—</b> demoting  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" cat="">Africa</a> 's second-largest  <b>oil</b> producer behind  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola" cat="country	state	colony">Angola</a> . The  <b>violence</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  pales next to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> , even now. "The differential is enormous in terms of the physical threat of being killed by a militant," said Ian Pilcher, a  <b>private security</b> consultant who has advised  <b>oil companies</b> in both  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> . " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigerian</a>  hostages are rarely harmed, if at all, and I can't really see  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_people" cat="group">West Africans</a>  ever setting up roadside bombs." The risk of death while pursuing  <b>oil</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> , however, comes with the potential for rich rewards. Current estimates put  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> 's  <b>proven oil reserves</b> at 115 billion  <b>barrels</b>  <b>—</b> more than three times the 36 billion  <b>barrels</b> held by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a> . Experts believe  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a> 's proven reserves could rise by an additional 70 billion to 80 billion  <b>barrels</b> once security conditions stabilize enough to  <b>allow</b> renewed exploration. That would give  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  the world's second-largest  <b>proven oil reserves</b> after  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" cat="country	state	nation">Saudi Arabia</a> . And  <b>oil companies</b> are maneuvering to gain access. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Iraq" cat="politics">Iraqi government</a>  recently signed a $3 billion deal with the  <b>state-owned</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetroChina" cat="company	stocks	warrant	enterprise">China National Petroleum</a>  to develop the Ahdab  <b>oil field</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Iraq" cat="">southern Iraq</a> . In September,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell" cat="company	dispute	brand	contractor">Shell</a>  signed a deal to establish a  <b>joint venture</b> with the state-run  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraqi</a>  South Oil Co. to tap  <b>natural gas</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Iraq" cat="">southern Iraq</a>  and is expected to spend $3 billion to $4 billion over five years on the project. Militants in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta" cat="disaster	accident	ecoregions	landforms">Niger Delta</a>  have repeatedly bombed  <b>oil pipelines</b> and kidnapped hundreds of  <b>oil</b> workers in an attempt to force the  <b>central government</b> to allocate more  <b>oil</b> revenue to the  <b>southern states</b> where the  <b>petroleum</b> is pumped. They have also set up a  <b>vast</b>  <b>smuggling</b> network to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of  <b>oil</b> stolen from  <b>pipelines</b>  <b>—</b> often with help from corrupt security officials and local politicians. That same scenario in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  is not far-fetched. "Oil companies can negotiate with the  <b>central government</b>, but if the  <b>local government</b> and local people are not happy, the  <b>oil companies</b> are not going to be able to do what they  <b>want to</b> do," said Amy Jaffe, an  <b>energy</b> expert at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University" cat="institution	university">Rice University</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baker_Institute" cat="">James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy</a> . The situation may be even more  <b>combustible</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  because most of the country's  <b>oil</b> is located in the predominantly  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people" cat="group	community	person	section">Kurdish</a>  north and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam" cat="dispute">Shiite</a>  south  <b>—</b> leaving  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam" cat="">Sunnis</a>  at the mercy of the  <b>central government</b> to distribute the nation's resource wealth.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  also has a better chance of establishing a security  <b>infrastructure</b> that is able to protect  <b>oil companies</b> and facilities  <b>—</b> including  <b>private security firms</b> and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_security_forces" cat="">Iraqi military</a> . In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigeria</a> , companies are required to use the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_Nigeria" cat="">Nigerian military</a>  or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria" cat="member	state	nation	colony	country">Nigerian</a>  security firms.
