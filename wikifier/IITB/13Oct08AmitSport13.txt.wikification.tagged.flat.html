<br><br>Turns out,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroki_Kuroda" cat="person	player	medalist	sportspeople">Hiroki Kuroda</a>  not only speaks  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language" cat="language">Japanese</a> , he speaks  <b>hardball</b>. For more than six  <b>testy</b>  <b>innings</b> against the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies" cat="sport	team	club">Philadelphia Phillies</a>  on Sunday, he threw them with cleverness and  <b>crankiness</b>. Then, in a single  <b>energizing</b> moment, he threw one with a message. The ball sailed behind the head of the Phillies'  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Victorino" cat="player	sportspeople	person	scout	winner	outfielder">Shane Victorino</a> , missing the player but thumping his team and denting this series. "It was not a message to them, it was a message to us,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" cat="club	team">Dodgers</a>   <b>catcher</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Martin" cat="person	expatriate	player	catcher	star	quebecers">Russell Martin</a>  said. "We will not be pushed around." Yeah, Kuroda said that. Judging from the way they whined and wailed and ultimately wilted, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies" cat="sport	team	club">Phillies</a>  also understood him completely. From the moment the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies" cat="sport	team	club">Phillies</a>  began pitching inside last week,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" cat="club	team">Dodgers</a>  hitters quietly fumed that their pitchers wouldn't protect them. "We didn't send a message,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Ramirez" cat="player	immigrant	bison	champion	drug	fielder	person	case	star	citizen">Manny Ramirez</a>  said.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuroda_Kiyotaka" cat="person	retainer	general">Kuroda</a>  may not speak much  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" cat="language">English</a> , but somehow he heard. He may be one of the quiet, forgotten members of the staff, but he had been doing this for 10 seasons in Japan, and he figured it out. "I didn't think I could hold them down unless I worked both sides of the plate," he said through an interpreter.<br>
