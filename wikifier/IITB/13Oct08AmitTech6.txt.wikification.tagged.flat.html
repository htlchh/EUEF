Better Solar for Big Buildings<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra" cat="manufacturer">Solyndra</a> , a startup based in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_California" cat="establishment	city">Fremont, CA</a> , has developed a  <b>novel</b> type of  <b>solar panel</b> that's cheaper to install and produces more power than conventional panels.<br><br>Unlike conventional  <b>solar panels</b>, which are made of flat  <b>solar cells</b>, the new panels comprise rows of  <b>cylindrical</b>  <b>solar cells</b> made of a  <b>thin film</b> of  <b>semiconductor material</b>. The material is made of  <b>copper</b>,  <b>indium</b>,  <b>gallium</b>, and  <b>selenium</b>. To make the  <b>cells</b>, the company deposits the  <b>semiconductor material</b> on a  <b>glass tube</b>. That's then encapsulated within another  <b>glass tube</b> with electrical connections that resemble those on  <b>fluorescent</b>  <b>lightbulbs</b>. The new shape allows the system to absorb more light over the course of a day than conventional  <b>solar panels</b> do, and therefore generate more power. What's more, arrays of these tubes offer less  <b>wind resistance</b> than conventional flat  <b>solar panels</b>, which makes them easier and cheaper to mount on roofs, the company says.<br><br>Chris Gronet,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra" cat="manufacturer">Solyndra</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" cat="occupation	executive">CEO</a> , says that these advantages ultimately reduce the cost of generating  <b>solar power</b>, although he won't say by how much. The company has raised $600 million in  <b>venture funding</b> and has orders for $1.2 billion worth of solar panels, which it sells through installers exclusively for commercial  <b>rooftops</b>. It started  <b>shipping</b> its  <b>products</b> earlier this year and is now  <b>ramping</b> up production at its factory, which will  <b>eventually</b> produce enough solar panels every year to generate 110  <b>megawatts</b> of  <b>electricity</b>. The company soon plans to start construction on a 420-megawatt-capacity factory.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra" cat="manufacturer">Solyndra</a>  is one of several companies that have recently received hundreds of millions of dollars to develop  <b>thin-film solar cells</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Contreras" cat="relations	person	leaders">Miguel Contreras</a> , a senior  <b>scientist</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory" cat="organization	building">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> , in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden,_Colorado" cat="city	seats">Golden, CO</a> , which developed the  <b>semiconductor</b>  <b>deposition</b> method used by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra" cat="manufacturer">Solyndra</a> , notes that several other companies have developed  <b>solar cells</b> based on  <b>thin films</b> using the same combination of  <b>semiconductors</b>; these  <b>thin films</b> are making possible a range of new forms for  <b>solar cells</b>, including flexible  <b>solar cells</b> and solar  <b>roofing materials</b>. "There's a lot more flexibility with  <b>thin films</b> than there is with [conventional silicon] wafer technologies,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Contreras" cat="battle">Contreras</a>  says.<br><br>The  <b>cylindrical</b>  <b>solar-cell</b> design has a number of advantages for generating  <b>solar power</b> on the flat  <b>rooftops</b> of  <b>big-box stores</b>, warehouses, and other  <b>commercial buildings</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary" cat="loanword">Ordinary</a>  flat  <b>solar panels</b> can catch the  <b>wind</b>, so they must be bolted or weighed down with  <b>ballast</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra" cat="manufacturer">Solyndra</a> 's panels consist of rows of  <b>cylindrical</b> tubes with spaces between them that allow the  <b>wind</b> to pass through, decreasing  <b>wind</b> loads and making it unnecessary to bolt or weigh down the panels, even with winds up to 130 miles per hour, the company says. <br><br>The  <b>cylindrical</b> design also allows the  <b>solar panels</b> to absorb more light.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_array" cat="component">Solar panels</a>  work best when light  <b>hits</b> them directly, such as when the  <b>sun</b> is directly overhead. To get more power from  <b>solar panels</b>, they're often mounted on tracking systems that keep each panel pointed at the  <b>sun</b> all day. But these tracking systems don't work in  <b>high winds</b>, add cost, and take up space that could be occupied by other  <b>solar panels</b>. The  <b>cylindrical</b>  <b>solar cells</b> provide another way to increase the power from a  <b>solar panel</b>. At any point in the day, some part of the curved surface is facing the  <b>sun</b> more or less directly, and therefore absorbing a large share of that light.<br><br>The  <b>trade-off</b>, of course, is that the other side of the  <b>cylinder</b> is shaded. With highly reflective  <b>white roofs</b>, however, this is less of a problem. Light passes through the same spaces between the  <b>cylinders</b> that allow  <b>wind</b> to flow through. It reflects off the roof and is absorbed by the shaded side of the  <b>solar cells</b>. Also, the other surfaces of the  <b>solar cell</b> absorb some  <b>diffuse light</b> from the sky.<br><br>This adds up to greater  <b>energy production</b> over the course of a year than a conventional system, the company says. Combined with low installation costs, this significantly lowers the cost of  <b>solar power</b>. Gronet says that within a few years, the company plans to produce  <b>solar systems</b> that generate  <b>electricity</b> competitive with the average cost of  <b>electricity</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a>  (about 10 cents per  <b>kilowatt-hour</b>) by optimizing  <b>manufacturing</b> and increasing production volumes.<br><br>The company, however, does not plan to expand out of the commercial rooftop business, where its specialized design has an edge. Other  <b>solar-panel</b> technologies may prove more affordable for other applications, such as residential installations and  <b>large-scale projects</b> for utilities.<br>
