Instead, the Inferno ignited what they hope to be a long-lasting  <b>firestorm</b> of success with a 3-2 win over the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" cat="state">Illinois</a>  Frontenacs. The win was the team’s first official win on home ice and went a long way in showing what it might be capable of. “We didn’t have to come from behind, so that’s good,” said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danville,_Illinois" cat="city	place	seats">Danville</a>   <b>coach</b> Chris Sislo. “It’s definitely a good way to come back after last night’s loss. That was pretty  <b>disappointing</b> the way that one went, giving up (two) power play goals. “It was a very good win, a very hard-fought win for these guys. They’re pretty psyched about it.”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inferno" cat="">The Inferno</a>  never trailed after Bobby  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Bann" cat="river">Bann</a>  lit the lamp  <b>—</b> assisted by Brian  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennessy" cat="establishment	distillery	brand">Hennessy</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary,_Louisiana" cat="city">Zachary</a>  Olson  <b>—</b> 17 minutes, 35 seconds into the first period.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Bann" cat="river">Bann</a>  and Olson then assisted on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Hughes" cat="alumnus	person">Cameron Hughes</a> ’ goal just over two minutes into the second, giving  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danville,_Illinois" cat="city	place	seats">Danville</a>  a 2-0 lead. But the Inferno displayed a bit of mental and defensive  <b>toughness</b> early in the third period. Up 2-1,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danville,_Illinois" cat="city	place	seats">Danville</a>  was hit with back-to-back  <b>penalties</b> that left  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" cat="state">Illinois</a>  with a  <b>5-on-3</b>  <b>power play</b> for 58 seconds and a 5-on-4 advantage for another 3:08. “It was hard. We just had to talk a lot,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Bann" cat="river">Bann</a>  said of the nearly five-minute penalty kill. “We had a couple guys that  <b>blocked shots</b>. Those are really big deciding factors. We just didn’t look back. We wanted to win it. We were  <b>looking</b> up the whole time. “I think that gave us a lot of  <b>momentum</b> to finish up and score some more goals. It was a really good effort from the whole team.”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danville,_Illinois" cat="city	place	seats">Danville</a>  goalie Jesse DiLillo saw some of his most significant playing time so far this season and made a case for even more minutes. DiLillo blocked 31 of Illinois’ 33 shots on goal. Getting a couple of early goals no doubt helped his confidence in front of the net. “It’s nice after the two losses to get a win,” said DiLillo. “Being up by a goal or two just helps you stay focused. It’s a little nerve-wrecking. It’s my first start at home. But just getting some goals early helps you play pretty good. You’re in the lead. You’re not trying to catch up.”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inferno" cat="">The Inferno</a>  added their third goal of the game when Olson (assisted by Cory Welnicke) found the back of the net just five seconds into a two-minute power play. The win keeps  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danville,_Illinois" cat="city	place	seats">Danville</a>  (5-1) at the top of the league standings, just two points behind the Chicago Huskies (6-0). The Inferno will be on the road for six games, including three against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" cat="state">Illinois</a> , before returning home on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October" cat="month">Oct.</a>  31 to host  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" cat="place	settlement	community	city	seats">Chicago.</a>  “We’re pumped,” said Bann. “We’re going to go to practice on Tuesday and work and keep on going. “It was a big win tonight because we got a lot of  <b>momentum</b>. We’re going to have a lot of  <b>momentum</b> in this weekend coming up.” Photos Danville’s  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_MacLean" cat="musician	person	convert	member	songwriter	performer	guitarist	singer">Bryan Maclean</a>  and Nicholas Bigelow (25) try to get the  <b>puck</b> past  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois" cat="state">Illinois</a>   <b>goaltender</b> Elliot Schmidt during the second half of Sunday’s game at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_S._Palmer_Arena" cat="venue	sport">David S.
