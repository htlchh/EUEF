This will help you recover from the training session so you can be ready for the next one, which will both cut down your risk of injury and allow you to improve your skills and conditioning at a faster rate.<br><br><br>Let's take a look at some general guidelines to get you there as effectively as possible.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate" cat="">Carbohydrates</a> <br>       <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen" cat="">Glycogen</a>  replenishment is absolutely critical after a workout, which means that you  <b>need to</b> focus on  <b>carbohydrate</b> intake. However, you don't need EXCESSIVE carbs, ever, post-workout or at any other time. But, you do  <b>want to</b> take in carbs after you train for several reasons.<br><br>      First, we do  <b>want to</b> replenish your  <b>glycogen</b> stores so that your now suppressed energy levels don't make the rest of your day (or night) a study in  <b>lethargy</b>.<br><br>      Second, and perhaps most importantly, carbohydrates elevate  <b>insulin</b> levels, which is the  <b>hormone</b> responsible for the transport of carbs and  <b>amino acids</b> into the  <b>muscle cell</b>. <br><br>      When this occurs, not only is the rebuilding of  <b>glycogen</b> levels facilitated more effectively, but the body begins to get back to an  <b>anabolic</b>  <b>state</b> leading to the repair and enhancement of your  <b>lean muscle</b>  <b>tissue</b>. Breaking down  <b>lean muscle</b>  <b>tissue</b> is the last thing anyone wants.<br><br>      The question of how many carbs and the type of carbs you should consume in this post-workout period becomes the next thing for us to look at.<br><br>      Given that the post-workout goal is to elevate  <b>insulin</b> through the use of  <b>carbohydrates</b>, you'll  <b>want to</b> consume  <b>high-glycemic</b> carbs post workout. Examples of high glycemics include  <b>white rice</b>,  <b>baked potatoes</b>,  <b>bagels</b>,  <b>instant oatmeal</b> and  <b>white flour</b>  <b>pastas</b>. <br><br>      The amount of  <b>carbohydrate</b> is going to be largely based on a few factors... your  <b>metabolism</b>, the intensity and duration of the workout and whether your primary goal at this time is to cut weight (for example, as you get closer to a fight) or maintain or add as much  <b>muscle</b>  <b>mass</b> as possible.<br><br>      As a general guideline, most of us have a total daily  <b>carbohydrate</b> intake that we shoot for each day. I would try to consume at least 50% of those carbs in the pre- and post-workout meals. As an example, if you take in 200 grams of carbs per day, take fifty grams before training and another fifty after, for a total of 100 grams. <br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" cat="protein">Protein</a>  & Fat<br>       <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" cat="protein">Protein</a>  is a very important component of your post-workout meal, while  <b>fat</b> is not. In fact, you  <b>want to</b> keep this meal as low in  <b>fat</b> as you possibly can.<br><br>      The goal at this point in your meal plan is to get  <b>protein</b>, carbs and  <b>amino</b> acids into the  <b>muscle</b> as fast as possible to begin the repair and recuperation process as well as rebuilding the  <b>lean muscle</b>  <b>tissue</b> that you <b>'ve</b> broken down during your workout.<br><br>      Fats slow  <b>digestion</b>, which is the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish. Ideally, you'll  <b>want to</b> take in lean  <b>proteins</b> such as  <b>egg whites</b>, poultry, fish and seafood. However, another option that you might find more practical (and easier to  <b>digest</b>) after you workout would be a  <b>whey protein</b> drink. <br><br>      As for the amount of  <b>protein</b>, take in whatever number of grams your nutritional program calls for you to eat at each meal. <br><br><br>Supplementation<br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine" cat="acid	supplement">Glutamine</a> <br>       <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine" cat="acid	supplement">Glutamine</a>  is a  <b>non-essential amino acid</b> that accounts for half of the  <b>amino acids</b> in your  <b>muscle tissue</b>. When you train,  <b>glutamine</b> is released from the  <b>muscle</b> to support your  <b>immune system</b>. As a result, for optimal results, you'll  <b>want to</b> replenish  <b>glutamine</b> after your workout. Follow the usage guidelines on the product that you choose.<br><br>       <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branched-chain_amino_acids" cat="acid">Branched Chain Amino Acids</a>  ("BCAA") are three  <b>essential amino acids</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine" cat="acid">Isoleucine</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine" cat="acid">Leucine</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valine" cat="acid">Valine</a> , that the body cannot make on its own. As a result, they must be supplied by your food and/or supplement intake.<br><br>      If you do not have sufficient BCAA levels in your system, your body will break down your  <b>muscle tissue</b> to get the BCAA it needs. Intense  <b>workouts</b>,  <b>cardio vascular</b>  <b>workouts</b> and lowered  <b>calories</b> (like when you are leaning out or dropping weight for a fight) all deplete BCAA. <br><br><br>      And an added benefit of BCAA is that they also help replenish  <b>glutamine</b>, which we <b>'ve</b> already  <b>discussed</b> is necessary after you workout as well. Follow the usage guidelines on the product that you choose. <br><br><br>Hydration<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration" cat="cause	disturbance">Dehydration</a>  is a  <b>dirty word</b> when it comes to anything that has to do with  <b>muscle</b>. Not only will you feel terrible if you get  <b>dehydrated</b>, but it will actually inhibit maintaining  <b>muscle tissue</b> on the  <b>cellular</b> level.<br><br>As a general rule, the more you sweat, the more you should drink, both during and after you train. I know its  <b>common sense</b>, but you  <b>need to</b> be conscious of it to maximize both your health and your results.<br><br>Your Post-Workout  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Plan" cat="">Game Plan</a> <br><br>Every time you train, you have a choice when that workout is over. You can take a few very important steps to get the full effect and benefit of all that  <b>hard work</b> you just did, or you can ignore these steps and leave a lot of your results on the  <b>gym</b> floor.<br><br>   1. Make sure to  <b>hydrate</b> during and after your workout.<br><br>   2. As soon as you are done with your workout, take your  <b>glutamine</b> & BCAAs.<br><br>   3. Sometime in the next hour or so, consume high  <b>glycemic</b>  <b>carbohydrates</b>, protein (whether solid food or a high quality protein powder) and keep fat intake to an absolute minimum.<br>
