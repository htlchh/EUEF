Ingraham was addressing the ninth Annual  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Public_Service" cat="prize">Public Service</a>  Week and Recognition of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensioner" cat="">Retirees</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_service" cat="terms">Church Service</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving" cat="holiday	festival	meal">Thanksgiving</a> , at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Catholic_Apostolic_Church" cat="organization	denomination">Christ Community Church</a>  on Bellot Road, which kicked off Public Service Week. "Our aim must be to achieve and maintain a high level of individual and collective performance. We must continue to position  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas" cat="member	place	state	country">The Bahamas</a> , not only to maintain our economic status, but also to adapt to any number of unexpected eventualities in the world's  <b>economy</b>, such as that being experienced now," said the  <b>prime minister</b>. Last Monday, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_The_Bahamas" cat="banks">Central Bank of The Bahamas</a>  advised  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas" cat="member	place	state	country">Bahamians</a>  to cut back on spending and avoid taking on additional  <b>debt</b>, adding that the deepening and broadening of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  financial sector crisis in recent weeks, will likely cause short-to  <b>medium-term</b> uncertainty for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas" cat="member	place	state	country">Bahamian</a>   <b>economy</b>, with implications for employment, inflation and government revenue performance. "The theme for this year's Public Service Week, 'Improving the Delivery of Quality  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service" cat="">Customer Service'</a> , appears to be a challenge today; it used to be the hallmark of  <b>public service</b>," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" cat="title	minister">Prime Minister</a>  Ingraham. He encouraged the workers to emulate the work  <b>ethic</b> of the retired  <b>public service</b> employees, who he described to be  <b>hard working</b>, courteous, disciplined and respectful. "Sadly, these core characteristics are not in abundant supply in our society today; and unhappily, this is reflected in our public service which mirrors our society," said the PM.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_(song)" cat="song	singles	record">Yesterday</a> , 13 public officers were honored.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" cat="title	minister">Prime Minister</a>  Ingraham said the annual awards ceremony is an ongoing effort to improve  <b>public service</b>. He encouraged the workers to make quality service their "hallmark and in so doing bring high praise to your profession and to your country." <br>
