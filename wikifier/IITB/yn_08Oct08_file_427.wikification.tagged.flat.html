Addressing  <b>850</b> business delegates at a luncheon organised by the Australia-Israel Chamber of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce" cat="">Commerce</a>  (AICC) last month, Smith described one of the greatest economic crises since  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" cat="1930s">the Great Depression</a> . Ive lived through -- and survived -- at least seven economic crises, he said. Everyone is very  <b>skittish</b>, very nervous, and least bit of information is often taken out of context. I believe we have  <b>18 months</b> to run of this extreme  <b>volatility</b>, he said. Following the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>   <b>sub prime</b> crisis and the  <b>subsequent</b> collapse of major  <b>financial institutions</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Australia" cat="economy">Australian businesses</a>  now face a tightening of credit availability and a softening local  <b>economy</b>. According to Smith, the  <b>credit crunch</b> could  <b>re-establish</b> a divide between good and bad businesses -- a divide that he said has blurred due to Australias strong  <b>economic growth</b> in recent times. If you think about  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" cat="country	state	member	nation	colony">Australia</a> , for 15 years, weve had very  <b>good credit</b> growth and access to equity has been extraordinary, he said. That has meant that good businesses have been doing well, but so have bad businesses. What were seeing is a return to normality. Good businesses will continue to do well, but bad businesses may not, he said. Access to credit should not be a problem for a good project -- if it stacks up, it will work, he said. If youre a good customer of the  <b>bank</b>, there should not be an issue. You should have access to credit.
