 <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" cat="">Bipolar Disorder</a>  Is Different for Women<br><br> <br><br>Women with  <b>bipolar disorder</b> sometimes mistake their  <b>mood swings</b> for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_syndrome" cat="disorder	syndrome">PMS</a> , and it's easy for doctors to misdiagnose the condition.<br><br>Diagnosing  <b>bipolar disorder</b> is a notoriously inexact  <b>science</b>. The disorder’s characteristic combination of symptoms—bouts of  <b>depression</b> interspersed with periods of an abnormally elevated  <b>mood</b> known as mania—is easy to miss or misread, even for trained experts. People with  <b>bipolar disorder</b>, who often receive an initial  <b>diagnosis</b> of  <b>unipolar</b> (or major) depression, can struggle with their symptoms for years before the disorder is recognized and treated. By some estimates, as many as half of all  <b>bipolar</b> cases are not identified.<br><br>Women with  <b>bipolar disorder</b> may be especially susceptible to  <b>misdiagnosis</b>. A recent study estimated that  <b>bipolar</b> women are three times more likely than men with the disorder to be incorrectly diagnosed. This disparity may be explained in part by the fact that  <b>bipolar disorder</b> tends to look different in women than it does in men—in the same way that  <b>physicians</b> sometimes fail to catch  <b>heart disease</b> in women because they are effectively  <b>looking</b> for the male version of the  <b>disease</b>,  <b>mental health professionals</b> may not always be aware of the distinctive signs of  <b>bipolar disorder</b> in women.<br><br>"Women are more demonstrative—they have more of what’s known as 'affective loading'—so it's not surprising that  <b>bipolar disorder</b> might be underdiagnosed in women compared to men," says Vivien Burt, MD, PhD, director of the Women’s Life Center at UCLA’s Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital.<br><br>Less  <b>intense</b>  <b>manic</b> phases<br>Jil, a 29-year-old from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi" cat="state	colony">Mississippi</a> , first experienced symptoms of bipolar disorder (depressed mood,  <b>insomnia</b>,  <b>excess energy</b>) in  <b>high school</b>. When she was 16, her  <b>doctor</b> diagnosed her with  <b>major depression</b> and prescribed the  <b>antidepressant</b>  <b>sertraline</b> (then known by its  <b>brand name</b>, Zoloft). The  <b>medication</b> made Jil "completely manic"—which antidepressants are believed to do in some people with  <b>bipolar</b> disorder—and a year later, a different  <b>doctor</b> finally diagnosed her as  <b>bipolar</b>.<br><br>"I <b>'ve</b> always had more  <b>severe depression</b> than  <b>mania</b>," Jil explains. "My depression is debilitating. When I’m manic I don’t sleep and sometimes spend money when I know I shouldn’t, but mainly I am very productive and mean as a  <b>hornet</b>. I used to cycle rapidly, but medications have slowed things down a lot, so I don’t have  <b>ups and</b> downs as  <b>frequently</b> as I did before."<br><br>Compared to the average woman with  <b>bipolar disorder</b>, Jil’s experience is unusual in some ways. The age at which she was diagnosed, for instance: Most people with  <b>bipolar disorder</b> have their first  <b>manic episodes</b> in their 20s or 30s, and research suggests that women tend to develop symptoms of the disorder three to five years later than men, on average. <br><br>n other ways, Jil’s story is all too typical. One of the reasons that  <b>bipolar disorder</b> may be underdiagnosed in women is that the milder form of  <b>mania</b> that Jil experiences appears to be more common in women. Although each case of  <b>bipolar disorder</b> falls on a  <b>spectrum</b>, rather than into neat categories, two main types of the disorder have been identified. The first, known as  <b>bipolar</b> I disorder, is characterized by pronounced manic—and even psychotic—episodes that often lead to hospitalization, and therefore a correct  <b>diagnosis</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_II_disorder" cat="">Bipolar II disorder</a>  features a more moderate form of  <b>mania</b> known as  <b>hypomania</b>, which is easier to mistake for an ordinary  <b>mood swing</b>. While the prevalence of  <b>bipolar</b> I is roughly the same among men and women, it has been  <b>suggested</b> that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" cat="">bipolar II</a>  appears more often in the latter.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" cat="">Rapid cycling</a> , in which four or more episodes of  <b>mania</b> or  <b>depression</b> occur in a year, is also thought to be more common among women, perhaps because it is more closely associated with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" cat="">bipolar II</a> . The same is true of so-called mixed  <b>mania</b>, in which  <b>manic</b> and  <b>depressive</b> symptoms occur simultaneously.<br><br>"Nobody really knows why this is," says Dr. Burt. "Again, women tend to be more  <b>demonstrative</b>, and part of it may be that you have a  <b>psychiatric disorder</b> overlaid on  <b>temperament</b> issues. Women are, if you will,  <b>hormonally</b> challenged throughout their lives, from month to month, and from reproductive event to reproductive event, whether it’s pregnancy,  <b>postpartum</b>, perimenopause, or  <b>menopause</b>."<br><br>Jil, in fact, has noticed that she can  <b>confuse</b> the symptoms of an oncoming  <b>depressive episode</b> with those of  <b>premenstrual syndrome</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone" cat="loanword">Hormones</a>  do appear to play a role in the course of  <b>bipolar disorder</b>, since childbirth and menopause—two other events marked by a rapid change in  <b>estrogen</b> and progesterone levels—can also  <b>precipitate</b>  <b>depression</b> in  <b>bipolar</b> women.<br><br>It is not uncommon for women to have  <b>mood swings</b> and believe that they are coming in with complaints of premenstrual syndrome ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_syndrome" cat="disorder	syndrome">PMS</a> ) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_dysphoric_disorder" cat="">PMDD</a> ), says Dr. Burt. "Properly evaluated, some of these women are actually going to show  <b>bipolar disorder</b>." The only way to make the distinction, says Dr. Burt, is to give the patient a  <b>calendar</b> of sorts, ask her to rate her symptoms on a daily basis—and then circle the days of her period.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" cat="">Bipolar</a>   <b>drugs</b>,  <b>pregnancy</b>, and  <b>side effects</b><br>The biological differences between men and women are seen most readily when it comes to the treatment of  <b>bipolar disorder</b>. Although  <b>talk therapy</b> has of late assumed a more prominent role, the disorder continues to be treated primarily through medication—often lots of it. Some medications prescribed for  <b>bipolar disorder</b> have been linked to  <b>birth defects</b>, however, which presents a dilemma for women of  <b>childbearing</b> age. (The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration" cat="">Food and Drug Administration</a> , for instance, has warned that babies born to mothers who take  <b>lamotrigine</b> in the first three months of  <b>pregnancy</b> may have a higher chance of being born with a  <b>cleft lip</b> or  <b>palate</b>. )<br><br><br>Women with  <b>bipolar disorder</b> who become pregnant will find themselves weighing the small risk of  <b>birth defects</b> against the risk of  <b>relapse</b>, which runs as high as 70% for women who cease their  <b>medication</b> altogether during  <b>pregnancy</b>. In addition,  <b>bipolar</b> women are especially vulnerable to  <b>postpartum depression</b> and its more severe form,  <b>postpartum psychosis</b>; a small  <b>2008</b> study that examined 56 women who received a referral for  <b>postpartum depression</b> found that more than half had some type of  <b>bipolar disorder</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_psychosis" cat="obstetrics">Postpartum psychosis</a> , meanwhile, is thought to be a variant of  <b>bipolar disorder</b>.<br><br>According to Dr. Burt, the current protocol is to keep women, especially those toward the  <b>bipolar</b> I end of the  <b>spectrum</b>, on a  <b>mood stabilizer</b> throughout the  <b>pregnancy</b>. In some cases, women with milder symptoms may  <b>decide</b> to  <b>cease</b>  <b>medication</b> for the first  <b>trimester</b>, or even for the duration of the  <b>pregnancy</b>, and then start again  <b>immediately</b> after  <b>childbirth</b>.<br><br>Jil currently takes  <b>lamotrigine</b> (as a mood stabilizer),  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duloxetine" cat="inhibitor	ether">Cymbalta</a>  (for depression), and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziprasidone" cat="">Geodon</a>  (for the "pesky background radio noises" that she experiences on occasion). She also used to take clonazepam (Klonopin) for  <b>anxiety</b>, but she is off that now and sees a  <b>therapist</b> whom she credits with helping her manage the  <b>anxiety</b> without  <b>medication</b>.<br><br>She has slowly begun to  <b>wean</b> herself off her  <b>medication</b>, however, because she and her husband  <b>want to</b> have a child. "I  <b>want to</b> completely go off  <b>medication</b> for the pregnancy—and that  <b>scares</b> everyone involved," Jil says. "I’ve been taking medications consistently for nearly six years, and it’s scary to think about what will happen when they are out of my system."<br>
