Many people today believe that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts" cat="group	dispute	person">the Celts</a>  used a  <b>calendar</b> made of thirteen months that was based on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham" cat="system">Ogham</a> , or the  <b>tree</b>  <b>alphabet</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graves" cat="critic	person	novelist	personnel	carthusian	officer	dispute	writer	collaborator	pupil">Robert Graves</a>   <b>helped</b> to make this view popular in his book,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Goddess" cat="book">The White Goddess</a> .<br><br>This idea has since solidified into the popular (among neopagans)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_the_Year" cat="">Wheel of the Year</a> , sometimes called the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taranis" cat="">Celtic Wheel</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year" cat="unit	order">the Year</a> . This is a circle divided into eight parts, with a  <b>festival</b> to mark each section. The eight festivals are:<br><br>Samhain (or Halloween) -  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_31" cat="days">October 31</a> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice" cat="holiday	festival	event">Winter Solstice</a>  - (approx.)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_21" cat="days">December 21</a> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbolc" cat="holiday">Imbolc</a>  -  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1" cat="days">February 1</a> <br>Spring Equinox (approx.)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_21" cat="days">March 21</a> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltane" cat="holiday	words">Beltane</a>  -  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1" cat="days">May 1</a> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice" cat="calendar	holiday	event	factor	mechanics">Summer Solstice</a>  (approx.)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_21" cat="days">June 21</a> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lughnasadh" cat="holiday">Lughnasa</a>  -  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_1" cat="days">August 1</a> <br>Autumn Equinox- (approx.)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_21" cat="days">September 21</a> <br><br>This  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_the_Year" cat="">Wheel of the Year</a>   <b>calendar</b> is extremely popular among  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca" cat="movement">Wiccans</a>  and  <b>neopagans</b> and it has a simple elegance to it. However, there is a very good chance that it isn't historically accurate.<br><br>Most academic historians and  <b>archeologists</b> believe that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts" cat="group	dispute	person">the Celts</a>  used something called the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coligny_calendar" cat="artefact">Coligny Calendar</a> , a complex (at least to us today)  <b>lunar calendar</b> of 62 months. A  <b>bronze</b> plate depicted this  <b>calendar</b> was found in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" cat="nation	country	state	republic	member">France</a> , so there is actual evidence that this  <b>calendar</b> was used.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graves" cat="critic	person	novelist	personnel	carthusian	officer	dispute	writer	collaborator	pupil">Robert Graves</a>  attempted to prove the truth of his theory about the  <b>calendar</b> by deciphering a  <b>poem</b> called The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amergin_GlÃºingel" cat="">Song of Amergin</a> . Each  <b>stanza</b> of this  <b>poem</b> allegedly is code for a month and for a  <b>tree</b> whose name marks the name of that month.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Goddess" cat="book">The White Goddess</a>  goes into this in great detail in a complex, somewhat convoluted (but still fascinating) discussion that spans many cultures and  <b>myths</b>.<br><br>My point in bringing all this up is to address a certain  <b>rift</b> that often occurs between  <b>academic scholars</b> and the followers of popular movements like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca" cat="movement">Wicca</a>  and  <b>neopaganism</b>. At one extreme, we have the scholars who simply dismiss the other school as ignorant and perhaps naive  <b>romantics</b> who believe things without evidence.<br><br>On the other side, there are those who argue that the scholars are simply  <b>authoritarian</b> representatives of the  <b>patriarchy</b> who are trying to continue their centuries-long suppression of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddess_worship" cat="">Goddess culture</a> . Right now I <b>'m</b> addressing this particular issue of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_calendar" cat="calendar">Celtic calendar</a> , but similar arguments come up over many other issues.<br><br>I would propose another way of looking at it (not terribly original I must confess at the outset) that is unlikely to please many members of either camp. That is, we can view notions such as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel" cat="">the Wheel</a>  of the Year as having a poetic,  <b>archetypal</b> or symbolic truth regardless of how "authentic" they are. In fact, by insisting that every aspect of your spiritual viewpoint be true in a literal, historic sense, you are really attempting to justify yourself to the  <b>rationalistic</b> mindset, which operates on a different  <b>frequency</b> altogether.<br><br>This, of course, also occurs when  <b>fundamentalists</b> of various religions attempt to say that their  <b>religious text</b> represents a perfect historical record. The fact is, it probably does not, nor was it meant to. The same holds true for people who follow  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddess_worship" cat="">Goddess</a>  or  <b>neopagan</b> type traditions.<br><br>So if a  <b>symbolic system</b> such as  <b>astrology</b>, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life" cat="">Tree of Life</a>  or the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taranis" cat="">Celtic Wheel</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year" cat="unit	order">the Year</a>  has meaning for you, then you can use it and enjoy it without having to justify it in a scholarly, historic or rationalistic way.
