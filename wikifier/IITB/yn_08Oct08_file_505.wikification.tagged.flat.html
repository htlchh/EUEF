A final report by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board" cat="investigator	accident	agency">National Transportation Safety Board</a>  investigators says  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  failed to  <b>fully</b> lower the single-engine plane’s landing gear and then tried to fly the damaged  <b>aircraft</b> after bouncing off the runway. “The pilot’s decision to  <b>abort</b> the landing with a damaged aircraft” is listed as the  <b>probable cause</b>. Icing and the pilot’s failure to lower the  <b>landing gear</b> are included as contributing factors.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  was coming into the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnstown,_Pennsylvania" cat="city	place">Johnstown</a>   <b>airport</b> because of  <b>icing conditions</b>, the report notes. Often a factor in  <b>air crashes</b>, the buildup of ice on  <b>aircraft wings</b>, tail and  <b>fuselage</b> impairs handling, airport manager Scott Voelker said. “Can  <b>icing</b> cause a change of flight characteristics? Absolutely,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voelker" cat="">Voelker</a>  said.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carburetor_icing" cat="problem">Ice buildup</a>  changes the shape of the  <b>wing</b>, reducing the lifting power, veteran  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnstown,_Pennsylvania" cat="city	place">Johnstown</a>   <b>pilot</b> Barney Custer said. Pilots often must increase speed to compensate. “Icing on the tail can really be bad for control purposes, near the ground,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custer,_South_Dakota" cat="city	seats">Custer</a>  said. The Flight Source  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company" cat="">LLC</a>  medical flight was traveling from company headquarters at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgantown,_West_Virginia" cat="town	city	seats">Morgantown, W.Va.</a> , to pick up a patient at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teterboro_Airport" cat="airport">Teterboro Airport</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" cat="colony	state">New Jersey</a>  when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Air_Route_Traffic_Control_Center" cat="stations	center">Cleveland Center</a>   <b>air traffic controllers</b> to report  <b>icing</b>. She asked to climb from 9,000  <b>feet</b> to 13,000  <b>feet</b> to get above the  <b>mixed precipitation</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controllers_(DC_Comics)" cat="supervillains	alien	character">Controllers</a>  cleared her for the new  <b>altitude</b>, but  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  soon radioed back to say the plane could not climb any higher because of the  <b>accumulated ice</b>. She asked to descend to 7,000  <b>feet</b>, and later to 3,000 feet. “We are barely keeping up with it,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  radioed, according to the investigators’ report.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controllers_(DC_Comics)" cat="supervillains	alien	character">Controllers</a>  responded they could not  <b>approve</b> a 3,000-foot flight because of the region’s terrain. Johnstown’s runways are more than 2,200  <b>feet</b> above  <b>sea level</b> and area ridges approach 3,000  <b>feet</b> and higher. Then  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  was approved to approach for landing at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnstown,_Pennsylvania" cat="city	place">Johnstown</a>  as an attempt to melt off some ice at the lower  <b>altitude</b>. A controller in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnstown,_Pennsylvania" cat="city	place">Johnstown</a>  tower asked if she intended to land or “execute a missed approach,” or fly-by. “It depends if my ice comes off or not,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  responded. “If the ice does not come off, we’re gonna land.” It was the last  <b>radio</b> call from the ill-fated plane. Watching the plane approach through  <b>binoculars</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnstown,_Pennsylvania" cat="city	place">Johnstown</a>  tower personnel noticed the wheels were not down and called to remind the  <b>pilot</b> seconds before ordering “go around, go around, go around.”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controllers_(DC_Comics)" cat="supervillains	alien	character">Controllers</a>  then saw the plane hit the ground hard, “like a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" cat="section	establishment	services">Navy</a>  carrier landing,” about 2,000  <b>feet</b> along the 7,000-foot  <b>runway</b>, and then appeared to take off again “almost perfectly,” the report said. About 2,000 to 3,000 feet later, the plane turned hard to the right, crashed into the  <b>grass</b> and burst into flames. Those first on the scene reported ice chunks scattered along the otherwise-dry  <b>runway</b> from the point of initial impact to the  <b>final crash</b> site. Investigators painstakingly measured  <b>grass</b> and  <b>runway</b> gouges,  <b>paint</b>  <b>scrapings</b> and  <b>skid marks</b> indicating the plane’s propellers,  <b>engine</b> mounts and a  <b>wing tip</b> hit the ground during the aborted landing. The space between the  <b>tire</b> marks showed the wheels were about 45 inches closer together than the landing gear’s “fully-down” position. Markings from the initial “hard” landing stretched about 400  <b>feet</b> along the  <b>runway</b> and nearby  <b>grass</b>. The distraction of trying to handle the ice-caked plane may have caused  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  to forget about the  <b>landing gear</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voelker" cat="">Voelker</a>  said, noting he witnessed similar incidents during his 30-year  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" cat="services	unit">Air Force</a>  career. “It happens where planes have landed with the gear up,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voelker" cat="">Voelker</a>  said. “It’s not common.” The investigators’ report shows  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McGee" cat="character	writer	agent	person">McGee</a>  had over 3,500 hours of  <b>flight time</b>, including 68 in the 30 days prior to the wreck. “That’s a lot of time in 30 days,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voelker" cat="">Voelker</a>  said. “She was an experienced pilot.” “Even the most experience  <b>pilot</b> can make bad judgments,”  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custer,_South_Dakota" cat="city	seats">Custer</a>  said. Flying over Pennsylvania’s mountains in bad weather and choosing Johnstown’s hilltop airfield may have been the first bad judgments, he suggested. “But it’s really hard to  <b>second guess</b>,” Custer said. Flight Source has not changed any of its procedures in the aftermath of the crash, co-owner Mark  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipley,_West_Yorkshire" cat="">Shipley</a>  said.  <b>•</b> Resources More from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_news" cat="">Local News</a>  section Maps, Menus, Store hours,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon" cat="">Coupons</a> , and more...
