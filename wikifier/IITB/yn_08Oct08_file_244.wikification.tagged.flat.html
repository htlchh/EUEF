Ozawa, 66, who has a history of health problems, went to a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" cat="place	game	city	capital	settlement	prefecture">Tokyo</a>   <b>hospital</b> late Monday after his voice grew so hoarse he had trouble speaking.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election" cat="election">General elections</a>  are expected as soon as next month. "I presume he's taking two or three days off as a break,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Hatoyama" cat="person	politician	engineer	owner	member	alumnus	academic	expatriate">Yukio Hatoyama</a>  , the secretary general of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiji_Ozawa" cat="prize winner	recipient	person	expatriate	conductor	director">Ozawa</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">Democratic Party of Japan</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">DPJ</a> ), told reporters. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">DPJ</a>  declined to provide more details but  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiji_Press" cat="dispute	medium	agency">Jiji Press</a>  reported that Ozawa was receiving fluid from a drip.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyodo_News" cat="medium	company	agency	cooperative">Kyodo News</a>  said that Ozawa left the  <b>hospital</b> briefly Tuesday but would return. "It's just a cold," a member of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">DPJ</a> 's  <b>parliamentary affairs</b> committee told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse" cat="agency	company	establishment">AFP</a> , adding party members "understand" his illness is not too serious. In recent days, Ozawa has been seen at party meetings wearing a  <b>scarf</b> and a small  <b>mask</b> over his mouth and reportedly complained that he could barely speak. A former heavy  <b>smoker</b>, Ozawa was hospitalised for 10 days last year due to fears of a  <b>relapse</b> of a heart ailment. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">DPJ</a>  is hoping for a landmark victory in upcoming  <b>elections</b> against the ruling  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)" cat="party	politics">Liberal Democratic Party</a>  , which has been in power for all but 10 months since  <b>1955</b> but has gone through four  <b>prime ministers</b> in the past two years.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper" cat="periodical	product	newspaper	format">Newspaper</a>  polls show that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">DPJ</a>  has taken a narrow lead in voter preferences. But  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiji_Ozawa" cat="prize winner	recipient	person	expatriate	conductor	director">Ozawa</a>  lags far behind his rival  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" cat="title	minister">Prime Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro_Aso" cat="catholic	person	expatriate	minister	alumnus	businesspeople	politician	writer	owner	member	shooter">Taro Aso</a>  as the public's choice to be the next leader. Ozawa, a former ruling party stalwart who defected in  <b>1993</b>, has a rough public image and won the  <b>nickname</b> "The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Beyer" cat="person	personality	coach	schoolteacher	scout	wrestler">Destroyer</a> " for his passion for battles in  <b>parliament</b>. Last week he presented to  <b>parliament</b> an outline of a DPJ-led government, promising to fix  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a>  's ailing  <b>pension</b> system , close the  <b>widening</b> gap between  <b>rich and poor</b>, and curb the powerful  <b>bureaucracy</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aso,_Kumamoto" cat="city">Aso</a>  took office on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_24" cat="days">September 24</a>  with a mission to lead his party into  <b>elections</b>. But  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aso,_Kumamoto" cat="city">Aso</a> , whose government has struggled in early  <b>opinion polls</b> , said Monday he would not call snap polls immediately. The health-conscious  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aso,_Kumamoto" cat="city">Aso</a> , who jogs regularly at age 68, appeared in  <b>parliament</b> on Tuesday, where he pressed the opposition on his demands for an extra budget to help revive the struggling  <b>economy</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuya_Okada" cat="politician	person	member	minister">Katsuya Okada</a>  , a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">DPJ</a>  executive member, told Aso to call a  <b>snap general election</b> swiftly after pushing through an economic package. "Public sentiment is demanding that the government implement economic measures before anything else," he said. "It would be the right way for the government to answer people's demands first and then dissolve the  <b>lower house</b>." The ruling party and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">DPJ</a>  agreed later in the day to vote on the economic package on Wednesday, with the opposition likely to  <b>approve</b> it. Aso is also pushing to extend a domestically unpopular  <b>naval mission</b> providing support in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" cat="">Indian Ocean</a>  to the US-led "war on terror" in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" cat="country	territory	dispute	republic	state">Afghanistan</a>  . The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Japan" cat="party">DPJ</a>  briefly forced a halt to the  <b>naval mission</b> last year, arguing that officially  <b>pacifist</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a>  should not be part of " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>  wars." The opposition has said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aso,_Kumamoto" cat="city">Aso</a>  should call a snap election before taking up discussion on the  <b>naval mission</b>.
