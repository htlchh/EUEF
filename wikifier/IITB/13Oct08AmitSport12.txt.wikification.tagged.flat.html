 <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Posey" cat="player	guard	men	person	pick	alumnus">James Posey</a>  woke up  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_18" cat="days">July 18</a>  feeling that he was still was going to be a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C." cat="team	company	club">Celtic</a> . But as afternoon approached in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Los Angeles</a> , his stint in Boston abruptly ended at one season as he accepted a four-year, $25 million deal to become a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,_Louisiana" cat="">New Orleans</a>  Hornet. As evening approached, Posey was put in the odd situation of celebrating his  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals" cat="final">NBA championship</a>  publicly at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPY_Awards" cat="award	trophy">ESPY Awards</a>  with his suddenly former teammates. After the most noted season of his career, the nine-year  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association" cat="league">NBA</a>  veteran knew this was his last chance to get a lucrative long-term deal. Posey learned not to think with his heart after being very upset when he was traded for the first time, from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nuggets" cat="">the Nuggets</a>  to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets" cat="rocket	team	club">Houston</a>  Dec. 18, 2002, with  <b>free agency</b> on the  <b>horizon</b> for him. Ex-Nuggets teammates  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Johnson" cat="player	men	christian	coach	person	alumnus	broadcaster	guard">Avery Johnson</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Van_Exel" cat="player	pick	coach	person	men	guard">Nick Van Exel</a>  explained to him that it's business, not personal. Since then,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Posey" cat="person	agent	presbyterian	officer	official	senator	member	general	republican">Posey</a>  has viewed his employment in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association" cat="league">NBA</a>  in a more businesslike sense. Posey wanted to stay in Boston, but he also knew this was business. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio" cat="">Cleveland</a>  native had to use his mind, even though it was hard not to  <b>follow</b> his heart. The Hornets' offer was too much money and years for a 31-year-old with two kids to turn down. Considering that the Hornets have All-Stars in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul" cat="men	player	guard	person	pick	medalist	american">Chris Paul</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_West_(basketball)" cat="person	player	men	alumnus	pick">David West</a>  and a chance to compete for an NBA title for years, the move made competitive sense for Posey.<br>
