The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" cat="authorities">European Commission</a> 's examination "showed that the overlaps between the activities of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashland,_Kentucky" cat="place">Ashland</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(1997_film)" cat="film	winner">Hercules</a>  are limited and that the merged company would continue to face several strong, effective competitors," the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" cat="authorities">EU executive</a>  said in a statement. "The Commission therefore concluded that the transaction would not raise competition concerns," the statement said.

Hercules mainly manufactures  <b>specialty chemicals</b> for the  <b>pulp and paper industry</b>,  <b>water-soluble</b>  <b>polymers</b> and  <b>wood rosin</b>  <b>derivatives</b>. The acquisition will give  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashland,_Kentucky" cat="place">Ashland</a>  a major presence in the  <b>water treatment</b>  <b>arena</b> that primarily services the  <b>pulp and paper industry</b>.
