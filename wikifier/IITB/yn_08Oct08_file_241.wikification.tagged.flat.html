A second public hearing was held Monday and the council unanimously approved the  <b>zoning</b> change. During Monday's public hearing on the rezoning,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Steele" cat="catholic	person	candidate	politician	alumnus	chairman	chair	adoptee	republican">Mike Steele</a>  of  <b>204</b> 6th St. addressed the council asking that they support this request for  <b>rezoning</b>. "We are asking that the eight properties be  <b>rezoned</b> from the general business to moderate density residential. They have never been business properties and have been incorrectly zoned for 15-plus years. Only two properties in this area that has been zoned  <b>business area</b> general businesses," Steele said. He said that this request for  <b>rezoning</b> is to "accurately reflect their historical, present and future use as  <b>single family residences</b>. The homes pre-date the adjacent two commercial properties, not by weeks, months or years, but by decades, and the homeowners are asking that this misclassification be corrected by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Mountain,_Michigan" cat="seats	city	place">Iron Mountain</a>  Planning Board." The homes are located at  <b>601</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnesec,_Michigan" cat="place	community">Quinnesec</a>  St.,  <b>204</b> 6th St., 206 6th St., 600  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway" cat="">Norway</a>  St.,  <b>606</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway" cat="">Norway</a>  St.,  <b>608</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway" cat="">Norway</a>  St.,  <b>612</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway" cat="">Norway</a>  St. and  <b>618</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" cat="state	country	member">Norway</a>  St. Steele added that these  <b>single-family residences</b> are located in a residential  <b>neighborhood</b>, front on residential streets and are surrounded by other  <b>single family homes</b>. There are only two general business property owners in this area. The business properties located in the area include Mark's Auto Sales,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics" cat="specialty	doctor	pediatrics">DCH</a>  Home Health, and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washboard" cat="instrument">Washboard</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-service_laundry" cat="">Coin Laundry</a> . He noted that their homeowners' rights that have been lost through the incorrect  <b>zoning</b> of the properties. Those lost rights include not having the benefit of a greenbelt  <b>buffer</b>, vertical screen, solid  <b>fence</b> or  <b>berm</b> provided along the side and rear yard. Steele asked that the council review the  <b>rezoning</b> regulations and that there may be other areas of the city  <b>needing</b> attention. The council then discussed the compliance issues relating to requiring  <b>green belts</b> or fences to separate businesses from residential properties.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_attorney" cat="occupation	lawyer">City Attorney</a>  Gerry Pirkola noted that they  <b>need to</b> look at how it is applied in different situations and he will check into it. Peterson agreed that the city needs to look closer at the rest of the  <b>zoning</b> in the city. At the meeting, the council also looked at the 2008-09 fee schedule for city services and approved the changes made. One of the additions made was the fees for local and non-local  <b>rentals</b> of the Fire  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_House_Program" cat="establishment">Safety House</a> . The council agreed to  <b>allow</b> the  <b>city manager</b> and  <b>fire chief</b> to be the authorized signatures on the rental contract. Other changes noted were the reduction in the fees charged for rental of the City Park  <b>pavilion</b>, which are in effect Jan. 1, 2009. The cost will be $195 for holidays and weekend for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Mountain,_Michigan" cat="seats	city	place">Iron Mountain</a>  residents and $100 Monday through Thursday. This is a reduction from the current fee of $280. The costs for non residents on holidays or weekends is currently $365 and has been changed to $250. The cost will now be $125 to rent the  <b>pavilion</b> Monday through Thursday for nonresidents.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_council" cat="council">Council members</a>  felt that these changes would make the  <b>pavilion</b> more affordable for residents to use. In other action, the council: - Approved the appointments of Barbara  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmo_Kramer" cat="character	version	gambler	actor	golfer">Kramer</a>  and Mike Nicometo to four year terms on the Downtown Development Authority. - Agreed to a  <b>hazardous materials</b> service agreement with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veolia_Environnement" cat="company">Veolia Environmental Services</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escanaba,_Michigan" cat="seats	area	place	city">Escanaba</a> .
