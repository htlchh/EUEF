Wireless at Fiber  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed" cat="quantity">Speeds</a> <br>There's no shortage of demand for faster  <b>wireless</b>, but today's fastest technologies--Wi-Fi,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G" cat="telecommunication">3G cellular networks</a> , and even the upcoming WiMax--max out at tens or hundreds of  <b>megabits</b> per second. So far, no commercial  <b>wireless</b> system can beat the raw speed of  <b>optical fiber</b>, which can carry tens of  <b>gigabits</b> per second.<br><br>One way to achieve faster speeds is to harness the millimeter-wavelength  <b>frequency</b> of the  <b>wireless spectrum</b>, although this usually requires expensive and very complex equipment. Now, engineers at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battelle_Memorial_Institute" cat="company">Battelle</a> , a  <b>research and development</b> firm based in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio" cat="city	seats	place">Columbus, OH</a> , have come up with a  <b>simpler</b> way to send data through the air with  <b>millimeter-wave</b>  <b>technology</b>. Earlier this year, in field tests of a  <b>prototype</b>  <b>point-to-point</b> system, the team was able to send a 10.6-gigabit-per-second signal between  <b>antennas</b>  <b>800 meters</b> apart. And more recently, the researchers demonstrated a 20-gigabit-per-second signal in the lab.<br><br>Richard Ridgway, a senior researcher at Battelle, says that the technique could be used to send  <b>huge files</b> across  <b>college</b> campuses, to quickly set up  <b>emergency networks</b> in a disaster, and even to stream uncompressed  <b>high-definition video</b> from a computer or  <b>set-top box</b> to a display.<br><br>Whereas  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi" cat="">Wi-Fi</a>  and  <b>cellular networks</b> operate on  <b>frequencies</b> of 2.4 to 5.0  <b>gigahertz</b>,  <b>millimeter-wave</b>  <b>technology</b> exploits a region from about 60 to 100  <b>gigahertz</b>. These waves can carry more data because they oscillate faster. Much of the  <b>millimeter</b> region is unlicensed and open for use; it has only been neglected because of the difficulty and expense involved in generating a  <b>millimeter-wave</b> signal, encoding information on it, and then decoding at the other end. Usually, data is encoded by first generating a low-frequency wave of around 10  <b>gigahertz</b>, then converting it into a higher-frequency signal. The drawback is that encoding data on a 10-gigahertz signal limits the  <b>data rate</b> to about one  <b>gigabit</b> per second.<br><br>The Battelle team was able to better this by more than a factor of 10 using  <b>off-the-shelf</b>  <b>optical telecommunication</b> components. The researchers modulated data on two low-frequency  <b>laser</b> beams, then combined the two. When these two beams combine, they create a pattern of  <b>interference</b> that acts as a 100-gigahertz signal. "It looks as though we have a  <b>laser beam</b> that has a 100-gigahertz  <b>frequency</b>," Ridgway says. <br><br><br><br>In the past few years, researchers at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology" cat="university	institution">Georgia Tech</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" cat="university	institution	contractor">MIT</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Corporation" cat="company	manufacturer	microprocessor">Intel</a> , and elsewhere have made  <b>great strides</b> in developing  <b>millimeter-wave</b> devices. Companies such as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Corporation" cat="company	manufacturer	microprocessor">Intel</a>  have even started pushing for standards that could help develop  <b>interoperable technologies</b> that operate at 60  <b>gigahertz</b>. And one company, Gigabeam, has rolled out  <b>products</b> that can achieve around one  <b>gigabit</b> per second using a  <b>point-to-point link</b> over a few hundred meters.<br><br>Ridgway explains that using  <b>telecommunication</b>  <b>lasers</b> has two big advantages. First, they are high power, so the resulting  <b>millimeter wave</b> is also of relatively high power. Second, the  <b>lasers</b> have been engineered to be  <b>stable</b> and dependable, producing a signal that doesn't fluctuate much compared with standard  <b>millimeter-wave</b> sources.<br><br>Alan Crouch, director of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication" cat="">Communications Technology</a>  Lab at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Corporation" cat="company	manufacturer	microprocessor">Intel</a> , says that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battelle_Memorial_Institute" cat="company">Battelle</a>  work is further evidence that  <b>millimeter-wave</b>  <b>technology</b> could become  <b>increasingly</b> important. "There's demand for more and more  <b>wireless communication</b> solutions in this space," he says, adding that "there is strong industry interest."<br><br>But the research may be years away from being deployed in a product. Ridgway explains that, since the system has been put together from existing components, it's much larger than it ultimately needs to be. In addition, a property of the signal called  <b>polarization</b>, which plays a role in  <b>encoding</b> data, tends to drift during operation, which means that the system requires attention when running. But  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridgway,_Pennsylvania" cat="place	seats">Ridgway</a>   <b>hopes</b> that, with some more  <b>engineering</b>, these problems can be ironed out. "We <b>'d</b> like to get it to a point where you could just turn on and go," he says.<br><br>
