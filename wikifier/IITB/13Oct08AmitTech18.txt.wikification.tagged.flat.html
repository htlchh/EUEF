Shimomura carried out further work on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a>  throughout the 1970s.<br><br>Unlike many other  <b>bioluminescent</b>  <b>proteins</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a>  doesn't need fuel to glow--it simply converts blue or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet" cat="move">UV light</a>  into green light. This quality has proved important for researchers using  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a>  to study  <b>cell biology</b> under the  <b>microscope</b> because it doesn't require the addition of other  <b>chemicals</b> that might disturb the  <b>cells</b> or  <b>tissues</b> under study<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Chalfie" cat="scientist	person	jew	alumnus">Martin Chalfie</a> , now chair of the  <b>biological sciences</b>  <b>department</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University" cat="university	establishment	institution	college">Columbia University</a> , was the first to demonstrate  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a> 's value as a  <b>genetic</b> tag. Chalfie realized that if the  <b>gene</b> for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a>  could be connected to the  <b>gene</b> for another  <b>protein</b>, then it would be possible to watch that  <b>gene</b> switch on under the  <b>microscope</b>. In  <b>1994</b>, Chalfie demonstrated the technique in a tiny  <b>worm</b> called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans" cat="organism">C. elegans</a> , which has fewer than a thousand  <b>cells</b>. He attached the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a>   <b>gene</b> to part of a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans" cat="organism">C. elegans</a>   <b>gene</b> that's only expressed in six of the  <b>animal</b>'s  <b>cells</b>; under a  <b>microscope</b>, these six  <b>cells</b> glowed green.<br><br>Chalfie's work demonstrated that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a>  could tell  <b>biologists</b> if a  <b>cell</b> was expressing a particular  <b>gene</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Y._Tsien" cat="biochemist	person	alumnus	scientist	member	scholar">Roger Y. Tsien</a> , a  <b>professor</b> of  <b>biochemistry</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego" cat="institution">University of California, San Diego</a> , built on the work of both Shimomura and Chalfie by developing many variations on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a> , each of which glows a different color, allowing researchers to track different  <b>biological</b> processes within the same  <b>cell</b>. By experimenting with variations in the sequence of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein" cat="protein	dye	method">GFP</a>   <b>gene</b>, Tsien developed  <b>proteins</b> that  <b>fluoresce</b> in shades of  <b>blue and yellow</b>. After  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language" cat="language">Russian</a>  researchers developed a complex red  <b>fluorescent protein</b>, Tsien also created a simpler-to-use version.<br><br>"It is imperative for researchers to map and understand the role of different  <b>proteins</b> and their interactions in real time in the body," says  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Zerhouni" cat="muslim	physician	person	director	recipient	immigrant	academic">Elias Zerhouni</a> , director of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health" cat="establishment	institute	agency">National Institutes of Health</a> , in a statement.
