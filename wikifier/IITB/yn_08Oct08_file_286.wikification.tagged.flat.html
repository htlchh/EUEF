The  <b>videogame</b> sector has ridden through  <b>recessions</b> in the past, but this time, it may not be immune to the market's  <b>roller coaster</b>. Even before Monday's  <b>dizzying</b> market drop,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard" cat="company	subsidiary">Activision Blizzard</a>  (nasdaq: - - ) shares had sunk to  <b>nearly</b> the same level as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision" cat="company	developer	subsidiary">Activision</a> 's stock traded at before it announced its giant merger last December with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment" cat="developer	publisher	company">Blizzard</a> . (It closed at $12.16 on Monday.)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts" cat="company	template	developer	publisher	member">Electronic Arts</a>  (nasdaq: - - ) is at a five-year low. The story's the same at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THQ" cat="company	developer">THQ</a>  (nasdaq: - - ). "We're probably more uncertain today than we <b>'ve</b> ever been in the 15 years I <b>'ve</b> looked at the category," says Edward  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Williams_(judge)" cat="">Williams</a> , an analyst with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMO_Capital_Markets" cat="">BMO Capital Markets</a> . Exactly how the  <b>gaming industry</b> will hold up during the holiday season won't be clear for several weeks. Data on the the industry's September sales are due out from  <b>market research</b> firm  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPD_Group" cat="company">NPD Group</a>  on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October" cat="month">Oct.</a>  15. Those numbers are expected to look dismal in a year-over-year comparison--but not, oddly enough, because of the downturn. Last September's release of " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(series)" cat="astronaut	introduction">Halo</a>  3" by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" cat="company	vendor">Microsoft</a>  (nasdaq: - - ) caused such a significant spike in software (and hardware) sales that this year can't help but look  <b>shabby</b> (even with the long-awaited release of " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(2008_video_game)" cat="controversy	game">Spore</a> "). Investors trying to assess damage to the industry from the downturn, therefore, should ignore the September data and instead keep an  <b>eye</b> on sales figures for October. Of course, investors are so  <b>skittish</b> now they may not factor such nuances into their selling plans. "We believe that September  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPD_Group" cat="company">NPD</a>  data scheduled for release in mid-October could add to  <b>near-term</b> concerns over industry sales trends and that shares in the sector are likely to remain choppy until there is better visibility for the key holiday period," wrote  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazard_Capital_Markets" cat="banks">Lazard Capital Markets</a>  analyst Colin Sebastian in a note last week. No one expects the industry to collapse this  <b>holiday season</b>. And, every analyst I spoke with said they continue to believe sales will remain relatively strong, compared to other industries, as the year marches on. Few are counting on  <b>stocks</b> to  <b>rebound</b> anytime soon, however. "There are a lot of people who are  <b>looking</b> for anything they can sell to  <b>lock</b> in gains they <b>'ve</b> made throughout the year," says John Taylor, an analyst with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia" cat="prefecture">Arcadia</a>  Research. "So you <b>'ve</b> got people just going after this group. It was the most resilient for a  <b>long time</b>." BMO's Williams agrees. "The stocks are not reflecting the reality of the current business trends," he says. "I think what's happening is sheer panic, and everything's being tossed under the  <b>bus</b> right now." Among hardware manufacturers,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo" cat="company	developer	publisher	owner">Nintendo</a>  (other-otc: - - ) should once again be in the best position going into the holidays.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii" cat="toy	introduction">The Wii</a> , while no longer the least expensive system, still has the widest appeal--and at $250 is still a palatable price for consumers. Despite increased production, it's far from certain whether the company will be able to keep up with demand, making this the third consecutive holiday it has been a hot gift. "There's no drop in demand for this at all," says Taylor.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" cat="company	vendor">Microsoft</a>  is in a  <b>somewhat</b> better position than  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony" cat="company	brand	manufacturer">Sony</a>  (nyse: - - ), thanks to a recent price cut to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360" cat="introduction	devices	emulator	toy">the Xbox 360</a>  to  <b>$200</b>. Both companies, though, are more  <b>reliant</b> on customers who  <b>want to</b> upgrade their  <b>gaming machines</b> either from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2" cat="introduction	toy">PS2</a>  or even the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii" cat="toy	introduction">Wii</a> . " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" cat="company	vendor">Microsoft</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony" cat="company	brand	manufacturer">Sony</a> , in particular, are going to have a harder time getting that person to upgrade," said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMS_Industries" cat="company	developer	manufacturer	game	publisher">Williams</a> . "It's going to be easier, based on current economic conditions, for people to say, 'Let's wait until a later time.' "  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher" cat="publisher">Game publishers</a>  are likely to see overall softer demand. Top-tier titles are likely to still post strong sales. Popular titles from earlier this year, such as " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart" cat="game	franchise">Mario Kart</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii" cat="toy	introduction">Wii</a> " and " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV" cat="game">Grand Theft Auto IV</a> ," are also likely to remain strong. But new  <b>franchises</b> and mid-level games may fall flat. "I think most retailers believe that the industry is going to have a really strong fourth quarter," says Taylor. "It may be later in coming than they thought, but the  <b>video game</b>  <b>aisle</b> is going to be the strongest area of any business." Beyond the  <b>holiday season</b>, however, there may still be problems for  <b>gaming companies</b>. While the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  is in the throes of a crisis now,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" cat="concept">Europe</a> , a big market for  <b>gaming companies</b>, is just beginning to feel the impact. A strengthening dollar could also create formidable headwinds for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  publishers. Regardless of how  <b>2008</b> sales turn out, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street" cat="street	fort">Wall Street</a>  sell-off of  <b>video game</b>  <b>stocks</b> could  <b>tarnish</b> its reputation as a  <b>recession-proof</b> investment. For what it's worth, though, that reputation might not have been entirely justified in the first place. The  <b>gaming industry</b>  <b>ebbs</b> and flows depending on how long it has been since new systems were introduced. As new  <b>hardware</b> hits the market, sales escalate for a few years, typically peaking after three or four years, then begin to fall off as people anticipate another new machine. Happily, those past peaks occurred when the  <b>economy</b> was trending downward. "Historically, the  <b>video game industry</b> has looked recession-resistant primarily because of the coincidence of where it was in the  <b>hardware</b> cycles more than anything else," says  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMS_Industries" cat="company	developer	manufacturer	game	publisher">Williams</a> . "I'm sure if the  <b>economy</b> were stronger, they would have sold more games."
