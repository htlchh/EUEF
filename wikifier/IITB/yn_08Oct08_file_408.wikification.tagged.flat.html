The  <b>military junta</b> , led by General  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Ould_Abdel_Aziz" cat="person	leaders	muslim">Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz</a> , made no official declaration as the midnight deadline approached. The National Front for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defense" cat="novel">the Defence</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy" cat="invention	election	loanword">Democracy</a> , a  <b>coalition</b> of five anti-coup parties, called for punitive measures against the junta, which ousted  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania" cat="country	state	republic">Mauritania</a> 's first democratically-elected president on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_6" cat="days">August 6</a> . "We demand the immediate implementation of  <b>sanctions</b> against the  <b>junta</b>, in line with the  <b>ultimatum</b> set by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" cat="">the AU</a>  if the military does not give up power," front spokesman Mohamed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Liberal_Democrats" cat="democrat	politics	wings	club">Ould</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouloud" cat="">Mouloud</a>  said. According to the anti-coup movement, there is an "escalation of  <b>repression</b> against all political opposition" by the  <b>junta</b>. On Sunday  <b>riot police</b> used tear  <b>gas</b> to disperse several small protests by supporters of the ousted president. The day after the protests,  <b>state media</b> made no mention of the incidents.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" cat="">African Union</a>  chief  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ping" cat="politician	person	president	representative	delegate	member	officiers">Jean Ping</a>  told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_France_Internationale" cat="services	broadcaster	stations">RFI</a>   <b>radio</b> that the military leadership had sent a delegation to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa" cat="place	dispute	region	capital">Addis Ababa</a>  , where the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Africanism" cat="movement	politics">pan-African</a>  body is headquartered, on Monday to meet for talks with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" cat="">the AU</a> . A source close to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" cat="">the AU</a>  confirmed Monday that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania" cat="country	state	republic">Mauritanian</a>  delegation was due to meet AU officials. He stressed that " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" cat="">the AU</a>  would maintain and reiterate its position on the return of  <b>constitutional law</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania" cat="country	state	republic">Mauritania</a> ."  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" cat="">The African Union</a>  has threatened  <b>sanctions</b> against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania" cat="country	state	republic">Mauritania</a> 's new military leaders which officials say could take the shape of travel restrictions and  <b>asset</b> freezes. But observers in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa" cat="place	dispute	region	capital">Addis Ababa</a>  say it is likely that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" cat="">African</a>  bloc will take its time to  <b>decide</b> the next move. In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouakchott" cat="city	capital	region	place">Nouakchott</a>  , politicians backing the  <b>military coup</b> shrugged off the  <b>ultimatum</b>. "We don't care about these ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" cat="">African Union</a> ) ultimatums, this doesn't scare anybody," said Sidi Mohamed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University_Liberal_Democrats" cat="democrat	politics	wings	club">Ould</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maham" cat="city">Maham</a> , a spokesman for the majority of members of  <b>parliament</b> who support the new military leadership. Setting an  <b>ultimatum</b> "has never solved any problems," he added.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" cat="">The AU</a>  warned the  <b>military regime</b> it risked "sanctions and isolation" if it failed to yield to its demands. But the  <b>junta</b> has categorically refused international demands to reinstate  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Ould_Cheikh_Abdallahi" cat="muslim	prisoner	person	leaders">Abdallahi</a> , saying it would not move backwards. The president has been kept under  <b>house arrest</b> since the  <b>coup</b>, according to the army. But his daughter,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Movement" cat="party	organization">Amal</a>  Mint  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh" cat="title	role	words">Cheikh</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Ould_Cheikh_Abdallahi" cat="muslim	prisoner	person	leaders">Abdallahi</a> , said his  <b>whereabouts</b> were unknown. "We don't know where he is, we haven't seen him since the morning of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_6" cat="days">August 6</a>  and we haven't even heard his voice," she told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse" cat="agency	company	establishment">AFP</a>  on Monday.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Ould_Cheikh_Abdallahi" cat="muslim	prisoner	person	leaders">Abdallahi</a>  was ousted hours after he issued a  <b>decree</b> firing the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania" cat="country	state	republic">Mauritanian</a>  military's top  <b>brass</b>, including Abdel Aziz, who was the commander of the presidential  <b>guard</b> . Since the  <b>coup</b>, the  <b>junta</b> has taken over the powers of the president and formed a new government with the support of a majority of the deputies in  <b>parliament</b>. The new leadership has promised to hold  <b>elections</b> quickly, but no date has been set and  <b>parliament</b> has voted to delay a presidential vote by at least a year.
