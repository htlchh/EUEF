By Published: October 7, 2008 ALBANY  Desk space was once such a  <b>commodity</b> in the cramped press quarters inside the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Capitol" cat="landmark	building	museum">State Capitol</a>  that a special committee would convene to  <b>decide</b> which reporters would get the coveted desks in the main room and which would be relegated to the outer offices. Nathaniel Brooks for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" cat="recipient	newspaper	source">The New York Times</a>  With  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Sun" cat="person	publication	newspaper">The New York Sun</a>  going out of business last week, five newspapers have now left the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records" cat="member	record	label	winner	company">Capitol</a>  in less than two years. That committee does not meet much these days. It doesn’t really need to: there are now just about as many vacant desks as occupied ones. One more desk was freed up last week when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Sun" cat="person	publication	newspaper">The New York Sun</a>   <b>ceased</b> publishing, becoming the fifth  <b>newspaper</b> to exit  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a>  in less than two years.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island_Advance" cat="newspaper">The Staten Island Advance</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Post-Standard" cat="newspaper">The Post-Standard</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York" cat="location	seats	city	place	area">Syracuse</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Gazette" cat="newspaper">The Daily Gazette</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenectady,_New_York" cat="place	seats	area	city">Schenectady</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Herald-Record" cat="newspaper">The Times Herald-Record</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middletown,_New_York" cat="">Middletown</a>  have all removed their statehouse correspondents from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records" cat="member	record	label	winner	company">Capitol</a>  since the beginning of  <b>2007</b>. The long, slow bleed of reporters out of New York’s capital has become more like a  <b>geyser</b> in recent years as news organizations try to reckon with shrinking  <b>advertising</b> revenue and falling circulation. This journalistic exodus raises questions about whether politicians and  <b>special interests</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a>   a place with  <b>tremendous</b> power and a history of how that power can corrupt  will be given the scrutiny they merit. “It’s discouraging, because there’s just so much power in the state government,” said Evan Cornog, associate  <b>dean</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_School_USA" cat="">the Graduate School</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism" cat="">Journalism</a>  and  <b>publisher</b> of The . If newspapers are not reporting on  <b>statehouses</b>, “it deprives  <b>journalism</b> of one of its sources of legitimacy: to be that  <b>watchdog</b>,” he added. “And it’s not as if we’re functioning in a  <b>transparent</b> environment. People are working hard to conceal stuff.” In  <b>1981</b>, the Legislative  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondent" cat="occupation">Correspondents</a>  Association, the organization of statehouse journalists in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a> , had 59 members from 31 news outlets. By  <b>2001</b>, the number of journalists had fallen to 51 and the number of news organizations to 29. At the beginning of this year, there were 42 journalists and 27 member organizations. With the exception of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York" cat="settlement	seats	city	place	area	location">Buffalo</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watertown_(city),_New_York" cat="seats	city	place">Watertown</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a>  itself, no city outside the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area" cat="area">New York metropolitan area</a>  has a  <b>newspaper</b> with a dedicated, full-time correspondent in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records" cat="member	record	label	winner	company">Capitol</a> . The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett_Company" cat="company">Gannett News Service</a>  has three full-time reporters covering the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records" cat="member	record	label	winner	company">Capitol</a> , but their correspondents are responsible for feeding all six  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett_Company" cat="company">Gannett</a>  papers in the state and are not assigned to cover  <b>legislation</b> that affects a specific city or region. Betty Flood, the owner of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyler,_New_York" cat="place">Cuyler</a>  News Service, whose reporters supply articles out of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a>  for various financial and trade publications, can recall a far different era. Still reporting after 54 years in the Capitol, Ms. Flood, 75, is the longest-serving  <b>correspondent</b> in the association and can recall when women were not allowed to join. “You just had so many papers,” she said. Gesturing to a section of the hallway outside the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Assembly" cat="house">State Assembly</a>  chambers that is now just an empty corner with a window, Ms. Flood said, “This was my office.” The walls, she explained, were knocked down long ago when there were far more reporters roaming the halls. “I worked for The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Banker" cat="newspaper">American Banker</a> . Gone,” she said. “I worked for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bond_Buyer" cat="newspaper">The Bond Buyer</a> . They’re gone, too.” The trend in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a>  parallels a nationwide decline in the number of news organizations that are committed to staffing statehouse bureaus. According to , the number of journalists covering a state capitol as a  <b>full-time job</b> fell to  <b>510</b> in  <b>2002</b> from  <b>543</b> in  <b>2000</b>. While the publication counted a slight increase in full-time statehouse reporters in  <b>2003</b>, the last year it conducted a survey,  <b>anecdotal evidence</b> suggests that the number continues to fall. A separate review by , the Association of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol" cat="landmark	structure	building">Capitol</a>  Reporters and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editors" cat="group	artist">Editors</a> , found that in  <b>2007</b> there were just  <b>407</b> reporters covering a statehouse as their  <b>full-time job</b>. The said that it had noticed fewer articles about state  <b>politics</b> in the news media and fewer reporters applying for credentials at  <b>state capitols</b>. Judy Patrick,  <b>managing editor</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Gazette" cat="newspaper">The Daily Gazette</a> , said the decision to close its  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a>  bureau was difficult but necessary. “We were faced with layoffs; I had to cut positions,” she said. The  <b>newspaper</b> now relies on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" cat="cooperative	agency	establishment	medium	recipient">The Associated Press</a>  to cover much of the  <b>day-to-day</b> business at the Capitol but uses one of its own reporters to cover bigger stories. The compromise seems to be working so far, she said. “But I would rather have a  <b>reporter</b> there.” For many news organizations, staffing a statehouse bureau was long viewed as a necessity  something more essential to coverage than having a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a>  bureau, which was considered more of a trophy investment. Compared with sending a  <b>correspondent</b> to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a> , opening a statehouse bureau was also more practical because the business of  <b>state legislatures</b> is often more relevant than what happens in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" cat="legislature	establishment">Congress</a> . The statehouse correspondents association in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a>  dates to  <b>1900</b>, when a group of reporters decided to host a farewell dinner for Gov. , who was leaving the  <b>state capital</b> for Washington to become William McKinley’s vice president. It is an organization known for clinging hard to vestiges of its past. Women were banned from being members during  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" cat="war	conflict	1930s	1940s">World War II</a> , a policy that was not reversed until the late 1960s. Women were also not allowed to participate in the organization’s until  <b>1972</b>. Now a third of the association’s members are women. But through much of the 1980s, the organization still had the feel of a stodgy gentleman’s club. Nightly  <b>poker</b> games with  <b>legislative</b> staffers and  <b>lobbyists</b> were a revered tradition, as was “the library,” a  <b>metal</b>  <b>cart</b> of  <b>liquor</b> that was wheeled out every afternoon. Today the  <b>liquor</b>  <b>cart</b> is gone. The  <b>poker table</b> still sits on the second level of the association’s office space  a  <b>balcony</b> known as “the shelf” that looks down on the main press room floor  but it is covered by a piece of  <b>particleboard</b> stained with  <b>coffee</b>  <b>mug</b> rings. Downstairs on the main level, the sets of  <b>wood</b> and  <b>brass plaques</b> that hang from a wall on the first  <b>floor name</b> various recipients of the association’s reporting awards. But they read like a death  <b>notices</b> column for the  <b>newspaper</b> business.

Some newspapers use Mr. Hughes’s service in lieu of sending a  <b>reporter</b> to an event in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York" cat="place	seats">Albany</a> . But whether Nysnys News and other services like it in other states are the  <b>chicken</b> or the  <b>egg</b> contributing to the decline in the number of statehouse reporters actually reporting from  <b>statehouses</b> is a difficult question to answer.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Hughes" cat="person	wrestler">Mr. Hughes</a>  sits in the press room next to the desk that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun" cat="">The Sun</a>  used to occupy.
