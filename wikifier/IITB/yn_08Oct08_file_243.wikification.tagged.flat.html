In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney" cat="area	place	city	game">Sydney</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia" cat="banks	entity">Reserve Bank of Australia</a>  cut its benchmark rate far more aggressively than expected  by a full  <b>percentage point</b> to 6 percent, twice as much as most observers had projected and the biggest cut since  <b>1992</b>. In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Tokyo" cat="album">Tokyo</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bank" cat="">the Bank</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a> , as expected, kept its key  <b>interest rate</b> unchanged at  <b>0.5</b> percent, having little leeway to cut borrowing costs further. The  <b>central bank</b> appeared to play down the chance of coordinating a rate cut with other major  <b>central banks</b>, but the bank’s governor,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaaki_Shirakawa" cat="person	banker	economist">Masaaki Shirakawa</a> , said coordination could involve working together with other  <b>central banks</b> to supply markets with  <b>liquidity</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" cat="cooperative	agency	establishment	medium	recipient">The Associated Press</a>  quoted Mr.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirakawa,_Fukushima" cat="city">Shirakawa</a>  as saying that each country should manage monetary policy independently. “It is not desirable to undertake policy coordination that would involve measures inappropriate for each country’s economic and price situation,” Mr.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirakawa,_Fukushima" cat="city">Shirakawa</a>  said, according to The A.P. The comments threw cold  <b>water</b> on expectations that financial officials from the countries might propose a coordinated, emergency policy move during their meeting later this week. In a nuanced shift in his outlook for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Japan" cat="economy">Japanese economy</a> , Mr.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirakawa,_Fukushima" cat="city">Shirakawa</a>  said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a>  might recover later than initially expected because of problems stemming from the  <b>financial crisis</b>. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_&_Poor's" cat="company	agency">Standard & Poor</a> ’s Australian Stock Exchange 200 index in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney" cat="area	place	city	game">Sydney</a>  was down 3.3 percent before the  <b>central bank</b> cut rates, but reversed its losses to close 1.7 percent higher. In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a> , the benchmark  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225" cat="warrant">Nikkei 225</a>  index fell more than 5 percent in early trade, to below the 10,000-point mark for the first time in five years, and closed more than 3 percent lower at 10,155.90. Although the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Rim" cat="region	dispute">Asia-Pacific region</a>  has not seen the extensive  <b>banking</b> troubles that have  <b>plagued</b> many  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a>  and European banks, it has not remained immune from concerns that slowing global growth  or  <b>outright</b>  <b>recession</b>  will take its toll on export-dependent economies. “The recent deterioration in prospects for global growth, together with much more difficult market conditions even for credit-worthy  <b>borrowers</b>, now present the risk that demand and output could be significantly weaker than earlier expected,” the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia" cat="banks	entity">Reserve Bank of Australia</a>  said in a statement accompanying its rate decision. “Economic activity in the major countries is also weakening,” the  <b>bank</b> said, “and evidence is accumulating of a significant  <b>moderation</b> in growth in Australia’s trading partners in Asia.” Governments throughout the region have stepped up efforts to contain the  <b>contagion</b>, especially as there is little evidence that the  <b>financial rescue</b> package passed last week in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a>  will soon  <b>salvage</b> battered international confidence. “I expect that the failure of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  to inspire confidence in the markets will have weighed on their decision today,” Scott  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udonis_Haslem" cat="person	player	men">Haslem</a> ,  <b>chief economist</b> for , said of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" cat="country	state	member	nation	colony">Australian</a>  bank’s move. Mr.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udonis_Haslem" cat="person	player	men">Haslem</a>  expects the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" cat="country	state	member	nation	colony">Australian</a>   <b>bank</b> to lower the key cash rate further, to 4.75 percent, by the middle of 2009. “Into mid-2009, with the  <b>global economy</b> in  <b>recession</b> and  <b>dollar</b>  <b>commodity</b> prices lower,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" cat="country	state	member	nation	colony">Australia</a>  will experience its most significant negative terms of trade shock in many decades (albeit from a highly stimulatory position),” he added in a research note. Even though  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bank" cat="">the Bank</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a>  suggested it would stand pat on rates, the government has signaled that it might deploy other tools to stimulate the sluggish, export-driven economy.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro_Aso" cat="catholic	person	expatriate	minister	alumnus	businesspeople	politician	writer	owner	member	shooter">Taro Aso</a> , the new  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan" cat="politics">Japanese prime minister</a> , said Monday that the government might expand an already announced $17.4 billion , saying that exports, which have driven the  <b>economy</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a>  for a decade, would “drastically decline.” “Japan’s exporters are being hammered and there is a significant risk of a negative  <b>wealth effect</b> from the falls in the  <b>stock market</b>,” said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_(name)" cat="names">Jesper</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOLL" cat="stations">Koll</a> ,  <b>chief executive</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Tantallon,_Nova_Scotia" cat="area	community">Tantallon</a>  Research  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" cat="place	game	city	capital	settlement	prefecture">Tokyo.</a>  “However, they do have tools available and banks here are well capitalized,” he said, adding that the next four to six weeks could see an announcement on additional stimulus measures. Elsewhere in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia" cat="">Asia</a> , soaring  <b>inflation</b> constrains some central banks’ room for maneuver on  <b>interest rates</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" cat="state	nation	republic	country">Indonesia</a>  on Tuesday raised its key  <b>overnight policy rate</b> by 0.25  <b>percentage point</b> to 9.50 percent, its sixth increase so far this year. But some analysts believe the tightening cycle has come to an end. In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" cat="republic	state	nation	colony	country	member">India</a> , too, double-digit price growth prevents the  <b>central bank</b> from lowering the cost of borrowing. Instead, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reserve" cat="division	reserves">Indian Reserve</a>  Bank of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" cat="republic	state	nation	colony	country	member">India</a>  on Monday cut the percentage of deposits banks have to hold with it in cash by 0.50  <b>percentage point</b> to 8.5 percent in order to ease conditions. In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" cat="country	republic	state	region	nation">South Korea</a> , the  <b>currency</b> has continued to fall sharply, hitting a seven-and-a-half-year low on Tuesday.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_&_Poor's" cat="company	agency">Standard & Poor</a> ’s, a  <b>ratings agency</b>, warned that its rating for the country might fall if worsening  <b>credit quality</b> among banks forced the government to take on significant additional  <b>liabilities</b> on its  <b>balance sheet</b> to ensure financial stability. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian" cat="newspaper	subsidiary">Australian</a>  central bank’s rate move fueled  <b>hopes</b> of a  <b>wider</b> international coordinated  <b>interest rate</b> cut.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England" cat="building	banks	invention">The Bank of England</a>  is in any case expected to lower its key rate on Thursday and the is widely expected to  <b>follow</b> suit before the end of the year.
