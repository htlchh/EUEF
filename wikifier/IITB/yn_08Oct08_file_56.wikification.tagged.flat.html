As  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a>  comes to a standstill to mark the most solemn day on the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar" cat="calendar">Jewish calendar</a> , producers of the  <b>cult</b>  <b>reality show</b> will deviate from the show's format, halting their coverage of participants' every move until the holiday ends after nightfall Thursday. They <b>'ve</b> also built a  <b>makeshift</b>  <b>synagogue</b> for a religious contestant. The shutdown is an unheard-of disruption in the  <b>24/7</b> coverage of the housemates' yawns, scratches,  <b>feuds</b> and inane conversations. Although the show airs on Sunday nights, those tracking the show on the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" cat="medium	invention	introduction">Internet</a>  will have to do without their fix for a full day, and those inside the house will enjoy relative  <b>privacy</b>, although _ in keeping with the show's rules mandating total isolation from the world outside _ they won't know it. Quarantined in a building in the  <b>village</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neve_Ilan" cat="place">Neve Ilan</a> , outside  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" cat="opera">Jerusalem</a> , since  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_3" cat="days">Sept. 3</a> , they also do not know that the country's  <b>prime minister</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Olmert" cat="person	politician	minister	mayor	jew	leaders	member">Ehud Olmert</a> , has resigned, or that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs_Minister_of_Israel" cat="relations	minister">Foreign Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzipi_Livni" cat="person	jew	politician	woman	leaders	alumnus	lawyer	member	minister	vegetarian">Tzipi Livni</a>  is now struggling to put together a new government. The housemates must live, eat and sleep together for  <b>100 days</b>. Along with viewers, they gradually vote each other off the show, leaving a winner, who in this case will collect 1 million  <b>shekels</b>, or about $285,000. There are 12 remaining contestants out of an original 16. According to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keshet_(TV)" cat="website	brand">Keshet</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis" cat="person">Israeli</a>   <b>production company</b> behind the show,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(TV_series)" cat="">Big Brother</a>  has been the highest-rated program every evening it has aired. In the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis" cat="person">Israeli</a>  version of the originally  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miljoenenjacht_(Netherlands)" cat="game	show">Dutch show</a> , which has become a guilty pleasure in some 70 countries, the remaining housemates include an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab" cat="">Arab</a>  woman, a  <b>gay</b> man, a formerly  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" cat="denomination">Orthodox Jewish</a>  27-year-old woman with a Cleopatra  <b>haircut</b> and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher" cat="person">Asher</a>  Simoni, 29, a  <b>postal clerk</b> and observant  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" cat="">Jew</a> . Simoni's religious observance has already meant that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut" cat="words">Jewish dietary laws</a>  _ like the ones forbidding mixing  <b>meat and dairy</b>  <b>products</b> _ are observed in the house. And every morning viewers can tune in as he puts on a  <b>prayer shawl</b> and intones the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language" cat="language	section	topic">Hebrew</a>  words of the daily  <b>worship service</b>. But his needs on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur" cat="days">Yom Kippur</a>  put more demands on the crew, a 150-person team headed by  <b>producer</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El'ad" cat="city	names	community">Elad</a>  Kuperman.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" cat="denomination">Orthodox Jews</a>  are supposed to pray in a  <b>quorum</b> of 10 men known as a "minyan." But there aren't any other religious people on the show, so Kuperman found nine volunteers from the outside willing to come and spend  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur" cat="days">Yom Kippur</a>  in the  <b>synagogue</b> he set up adjacent to the  <b>quarantined</b> house. The prayer house has been equipped with pews, an  <b>ark</b> containing two  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" cat="words">Torah</a>  scrolls and a remote-controlled  <b>camera</b> peering in through one window. A sign outside bears the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Nineteen_Eighty-Four)" cat="character	dictator	personification">Big Brother</a>   <b>logo</b>, an  <b>all-seeing eye</b>, and a  <b>tongue-in-cheek</b> verse from Proverbs: "The  <b>eye</b> sees and the  <b>ear</b> hears, and all of your deeds are inscribed in the book." The nine men have signed forms promising not to speak to Simoni or any of the other housemates who might wander in. The deviation from the format had to be approved by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemol" cat="company">Endemol</a> , the Holland-based  <b>production company</b> that licenses  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(TV_series)" cat="">Big Brother</a> . "It's unique, but we are under the umbrella of all the rules of the format," Kuperman said. " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(TV_series)" cat="">Big Brother</a> " will resume normal operations Thursday evening as the country returns to its  <b>frenetic</b> pace following the  <b>ritual</b> blast of the  <b>shofar</b>, a traditional  <b>ram</b>'s  <b>horn</b>.
