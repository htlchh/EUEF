Publisher: REVIEW Movie Review: Days of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven" cat="dispute	place">Heaven</a>  Written by Published October 07, 2008 See also: » » »  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(song)" cat="singles	ballad	song	symbol	record">Imagine</a>  traveling across the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Panhandle" cat="region">Texas Panhandle</a>  and eyeing a  <b>farmhouse</b>, vacant, decaying, and leaning precariously after being howled at by winds for  <b>nearly</b> a century. Filled with curiosity, you pull your car over,  <b>trudge</b> across what used to be a  <b>wheat</b> field, and take a closer look. The door is ajar so you enter. The floor is scattered with  <b>dust</b>,  <b>tumbleweeds</b>, dead  <b>locusts</b>, and a trunk. Inside the trunk, you find  <b>old photographs</b> strewn every which way and, intrigued, you start pulling them out one by one for a closer look. Gradually, pictures of the newly built  <b>farmhouse</b>; freight trains stacked with human cargo;  <b>horses</b>  <b>grazing</b>; a man, a woman, and a young girl sharing a  <b>picnic</b> (are they husband, wife, and daughter?);  <b>farm</b> workers harvesting  <b>wheat</b>; a congregation with heads bowed in  <b>prayer</b>; and  <b>locusts</b>, very much alive, crawling over a  <b>kitchen table</b> all start to coalesce into a story. Then you see a picture of that same woman in a lover’s embrace with a different man and the beginnings of  <b>melodrama</b> take hold. Hurriedly, you start laying the pictures out on the dusty floor, arranging them one way, and then another. The story’s fragmented with huge gaps, gaps you try to fill in with pictures of nature, pictures often startlingly beautiful like a storm slowly rolling across a plain. You lie down on the floor, face almost touching each image in succession as if trying to erase time itself and you begin to hear the voice of that young girl  <b>precociously</b> telling a tragic story from long ago... This is the effect that Terrence Malick’s masterpiece  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Heaven" cat="film">Days of Heaven</a>  has on the viewer, one of hauntingly beautiful images that ever so casually and sometimes even unexpectedly find a story to tell. (It won  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" cat="award">the Oscar</a>  for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography" cat="award">Best Cinematography</a>  and it is one of a small handful of the most gorgeous movies ever made.) The story follows a young man (a very young  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gere" cat="convert	buddhist	activist	actor	person	winner">Richard Gere</a> ), his lover who pretends to be his sister, and his actual young sister, the story’s narrator. They are on the run. Did he actually murder that man? We can’t be sure. They find work as hired hands on a  <b>harvest</b>. The  <b>farm</b> owner is young and handsome ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Shepard" cat="person	screenwriter	actor	dramatist	member">Sam Shepard</a> ) and dying. Seeing an opportunity to gain riches, the young woman marries the  <b>farm</b> owner. But,  <b>marriage</b> has a rejuvenating effect on him. He stops dying. Will he die? Or will she fall in love with him for real? Talking about  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Heaven" cat="film">Days of Heaven</a>  in terms of plot is almost to  <b>misrepresent</b> it. Malick spent many long days waiting until  <b>magic hour</b> working with cinematographer Néstor Almendros to craft one stunning  <b>light painting</b> after another. The rest of each day was spent with  <b>macro lenses</b> capturing the minutiae of  <b>farm</b> existence in screen-filling  <b>extreme close-ups</b>. He then spent a legendary two years in the editing room stitching the countless pictures together, first one way, and then many others, until an eye-pleasing perfection was achieved. Haunting music and Linda Manz’s offhand, highly influential narration, full of unfinished thoughts and stray  <b>tangents</b> are the  <b>glue</b> that finally binds this most remarkably singular work of art together. I wouldn’t be surprised if one day I came across the reclusive Malick’s unpublished memoirs, possibly in a trunk in an old abandoned  <b>farm</b> house, and he admitted to editing  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Heaven" cat="film">Days of Heaven</a>  by stretching out on the floor with his footage and squinting and rearranging the strips until the many voices started to whisper their stories in his  <b>ear</b> from days long ago. Todd is an avid  <b>film</b>  <b>buff</b>,  <b>web developer</b>, and passionate enthusiast of  <b>competitive swimming</b>. He shares his living space with his wife, two daughters, six  <b>cats</b> and two dogs.
