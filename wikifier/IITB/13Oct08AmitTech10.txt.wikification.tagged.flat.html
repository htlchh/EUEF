Attacking  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell" cat="cell">Cancer Stem Cells</a> <br><br>A screening approach identifies  <b>drugs</b> that halt  <b>cells</b> that feed  <b>tumors</b>.<br><br>All  <b>cancer cells</b> were once thought to be equal, but recent research suggests otherwise. A growing body of evidence indicates that only certain  <b>cancer cells</b> are capable of generating and maintaining a  <b>tumor</b>. Dubbed  <b>cancer stem cells</b>, they can divide indefinitely to perpetuate the  <b>cancer</b> over time. They may also be the reason why some therapies fail to wipe out a cancer entirely: cancer stem cells seem to be  <b>particularly</b> resistant to standard  <b>cancer treatments</b> and can remain behind like the roots of a  <b>weed</b>.<br><br>If this  <b>hypothesis</b> holds true,  <b>cancer stem cells</b> could be the most promising target for new therapies. A team of researchers at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School" cat="establishment	university	school">Harvard Medical School</a>  has now developed a new way to find  <b>drugs</b> that selectively kill  <b>cancer stem cells</b> or prevent them from dividing. The team is currently using the method to identify drug candidates for  <b>leukemia</b>, a  <b>disease</b> for which  <b>cancer stem cells</b> have been well characterized. The researchers believe that the approach could  <b>eventually</b> extend to other kinds of  <b>cancer</b>.<br><br>David Scadden, cochair of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" cat="university	establishment	institution	college">Harvard</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" cat="cell">Stem Cell</a>  Institute and a collaborator on the project, says that typical high-throughput drug screens, which use  <b>cell lines</b> grown in  <b>petri dishes</b>, don't always yield good results because the  <b>cells</b> are too removed from their natural context. With  <b>stem cells</b> in particular, he says, "the  <b>microenvironment</b> seems to be an important contributor for how the  <b>cells</b> function." When grown in the lab, the  <b>cells</b> can lose their "stemness," or ability to generate new  <b>cells</b>. Instead, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" cat="university	establishment	institution	college">Harvard</a>   <b>drug-screening</b> method uses  <b>cells</b> taken directly from diseased animals.<br><br>To better mimic the  <b>natural environment</b> of  <b>cancer stem cells</b>, the team incorporated other  <b>cells</b> that support them. "Cancer cells don't exist in isolation," says Kimberly Hartwell, a research fellow at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital" cat="hospital">Brigham and Women's Hospital</a> , who  <b>helped</b> lead the project. In  <b>tissues</b>, she says, these  <b>cells</b> "may hijack the support system--what we call the  <b>stromal cells</b>."  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromal_cell" cat="cell">Stromal cells</a>  form  <b>connective tissue</b> surrounding an  <b>organ</b>; scientists believe that they help provide an environment where stem  <b>cells</b> flourish.<br><br>To find treatments for  <b>leukemia</b>, the team first isolated  <b>leukemic</b>  <b>stem cells</b> from the  <b>bone marrow</b> of diseased  <b>mice</b>, then added them to  <b>stromal cells</b> from the  <b>bone marrow</b>. These two  <b>cell</b> types were placed in plates with tiny wells that can be treated with  <b>drugs</b> and analyzed using robotic methods. By transplanting the  <b>leukemic</b>  <b>stem cells</b> into a healthy  <b>mouse</b>, the scientists have confirmed that the  <b>cells</b> retain their ability to form new  <b>cancerous</b>  <b>cells</b> for up to four weeks. <br><br><br><br>To determine how different  <b>drugs</b> affect the  <b>cells</b>, scientists use an imaging analysis method developed in collaboration with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Institute" cat="laboratory	institution">Broad Institute</a> . The  <b>automated system</b> searches for  <b>drugs</b> that decrease the number of  <b>leukemic</b>  <b>stem cells</b>, which are labeled with a  <b>fluorescent</b> red marker. The  <b>software</b> also analyzes the structure of the  <b>cells</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia" cat="disorder">Leukemic</a>  stem  <b>cells</b> tend to group together to form structures called  <b>cobblestones</b>, which Hartwell describes as "a biological readout of stemness." By evaluating the number of  <b>cobblestone</b> formations, the team can find  <b>drugs</b> that interfere with the activity of  <b>cancer stem cells</b>.<br><br>The researchers are currently screening  <b>libraries</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approved_drug" cat="">FDA-approved drugs</a>  and known  <b>bioactive compounds</b>, as well as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA" cat="">RNA</a>   <b>molecules</b>. They are also using  <b>libraries</b> of compounds, developed by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Schreiber" cat="person	chemist	alumnus">Stuart Schreiber</a>  at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Institute" cat="laboratory	institution">Broad Institute</a> , known to prevent the type of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" cat="">DNA</a>  alterations seen in  <b>leukemia</b>. The team has already identified compounds that can kill off  <b>cancer stem cells</b> without affecting  <b>stromal cells</b>.<br><br>Scadden's team is also performing parallel tests on normal  <b>bone-marrow</b>  <b>stem cells</b>, in order to identify compounds that specifically target  <b>cancer stem cells</b> without killing their normal counterparts. Scadden says that these studies could also provide potential treatments for diseases beyond  <b>cancer</b> by identifying  <b>drugs</b> that expand normal  <b>stem cells</b>.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Weinberg" cat="person	member	recipient	biologist">Robert Weinberg</a> , a  <b>professor</b> of  <b>biology</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" cat="university	institution	contractor">MIT</a> , believes that the overall idea of targeting  <b>cancer stem cells</b> is an attractive one because it suggests a path to therapies that are  <b>truly</b> curative. But he says that it's not clear whether the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" cat="university	establishment	institution	college">Harvard</a>  screening approach will be applicable to  <b>solid tumors</b>, rather than to  <b>cancers</b> of the  <b>blood</b> like  <b>leukemia</b>. He also cautions that the approach faces some difficulties. "It's already clear that  <b>cancer stem cells</b> are more resistant to most therapies than the bulk of the  <b>cancer cells</b> in the  <b>tumor</b>," he says. Furthermore, if it is possible to wipe out  <b>cancer stem cells</b> selectively, it still remains unproven whether doing so will  <b>truly</b> eradicate the  <b>tumor</b>.<br><br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell" cat="cell">Cancer stem cells</a>  were first identified in  <b>leukemia</b> in  <b>1994</b>, but in the past several years, the  <b>cancer stem-cell</b>  <b>hypothesis</b> has gained ground as  <b>stem cells</b> have been identified in other types of  <b>cancer</b>, including those of the  <b>breast</b>,  <b>prostate</b>,  <b>brain</b>, and  <b>pancreas</b>. Although most scientists now agree that  <b>cancer</b> stem  <b>cells</b> exist, they still debate the cells' exact role in  <b>cancer</b>. Other types of  <b>cancer</b> pose a greater challenge for screening than do  <b>blood cancers</b> such as  <b>leukemia</b> because the  <b>cancer stem cells</b> are buried within  <b>solid tumors</b>, making them more difficult to access and characterize.<br><br>
