She was  <b>assassinated</b> after an  <b>election campaign</b> rally on Dec. 27, 2007, two weeks before the  <b>2008 general election</b>, in which she was a leading opposition candidate. The  <b>charismatic</b>  <b>politician</b> and mother of five wrote this  <b>essay</b>, "One Day" on June 17, 1997, which appears in the  <b>anthology</b> "The Maternal is Political." "One Day" When I graduated from  <b>university</b> in the 70s, I was  <b>thrilled</b>. My  <b>education</b> was over. A life of exams, grades, waiting for results was part of the past. I was wrong. Life is one big exam. And whether it is an election, a speech, a court decision, or a domestic matter, I am always wondering whether I am going to pass or fail, whether I am going to make the grade or not. Some days are good. Some days are not. As  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" cat="convert	chemist	person	leaders	survivor	methodists	lawyer	secretary	peer	member	critic	head	woman	chancellor	anglican	dispute">Lady Thatcher</a>  once said to me, In  <b>politics</b>, always expect the unexpected. I would only add, In life, always expect the unexpected. As leader of the opposition in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Pakistan" cat="house">National Assembly of Pakistan</a> , I have to open the debate on the budget proposal tomorrow. I get up today and head straight for the big bundle of budget documents, which the  <b>finance minister</b> has placed on the floor of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Pakistan" cat="house">National Assembly</a> . I finish the  <b>first reading</b> of the budget documents by lunchtime. I find that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Bureau_(Pakistan)" cat="agency">Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan</a>  spent  <b>one-third</b> over its allocation. Was this huge expenditure to rig the  <b>general elections</b> held this February, to fund my opponents, to  <b>bribe</b> witnesses into giving false statements, or to  <b>bribe</b> journalists into writing negative stories? These questions whirl in my mind. Last November, my government was dismissed by  <b>presidential decree</b> on the eve of our signing an agreement with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" cat="establishment	institution	economics	nation">International Monetary Fund</a> . A  <b>witchhunt</b> was launched. It still continues. That night of November 4, 1996, my husband was kidnapped by  <b>security agents</b>. He was produced 48 hours later after we raised a  <b>hue and cry</b>. For eight months, he has languished in a  <b>prison cell</b> in  <b>solitary confinement</b>, with temperatures soaring to 48 degrees  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius" cat="unit">Celsius</a> . He has not been  <b>indicted</b> in a single case so far, despite the governments tall claims that he was The King of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption" cat="terms">Corruption</a> . Later in the afternoon, my cousin Fakhri comes to our house along with her three grandchildren. I send them, along with my own three kids, to have  <b>pizza</b> and  <b>chocolate cake</b>. They shout with delight. Children are so easy to please. What happens to us when we become adults?  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy" cat="practice	mummy	words	type">Mummy</a> , Fakhri, and I have lunch. The cook has made  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_diversicolor" cat="myrtales	forest	plant">Karri</a>  . It is made with  <b>yogurt</b> and  <b>gram flour</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy" cat="practice	mummy	words	type">Mummy</a>  says it is delicious, so her cook must have made it.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy" cat="practice	mummy	words	type">Mummy</a>  has just returned from a  <b>religious pilgrimage</b>. She says she prayed really hard for me and our party workers, and things are going to get better. Let us hope so. After lunch, we sip  <b>green tea</b> and chat until the sound of shouts and screams heralds the return of the children. The kids now demand to see a  <b>cartoon</b>. I do not like my children watching  <b>cartoons</b>. But I am feeling guilty. I have to catch a flight to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad" cat="establishment	council	capital	area">Islamabad</a> , where the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="legislature	parliament	dispute	establishment">Parliament</a>  is based. So I cave in. As I come down the stairs to leave for the  <b>airport</b>, my seven-year-old daughter, Bakhtwar, looks up. Casually waving, she says, Bye, it was nice seeing you. Come back soon. What do you mean? I say. I am your mother. I am  <b>stuck</b> to you like that arm of yours for life. But Mama, my arm keeps going away, she complains. But it always comes back, I reply. Yes, it does, it does, says my eight-year-old son,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilawal" cat="">Bilawal</a> , as he gives me a hug. On the flight, I see my  <b>mother-in-law</b>. We say hello. She says the regime is still bothering my father-in-law. He is in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore" cat="city	capital	area	place">Lahore</a> , meeting lawyers in connection with politically motivated allegations made against him. I write my speech by hand during the two-hour plane journey from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi" cat="capital	city	port	place	area">Karachi</a>  to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad" cat="establishment	council	capital	area">Islamabad</a> . I rush home and into my study to complete the speech. Once the  <b>draft</b> is finished, I call my party leaders to  <b>vet</b> the draft. While they are doing that, I binge on  <b>pizza</b> and  <b>chocolate cake</b>. It is four in the morning by the time we finish. We leave the speech for typing, translation, and copying, and call it a day.

This  <b>essay</b> first appeared on  <b>slate.com</b> on June 17, 1997. A note from the  <b>editor</b> of "The Maternal is Political": As the  <b>editor</b> of the  <b>anthology</b> about  <b>motherhood</b> and  <b>politics</b>, "The Maternal Is Political: Women Writers at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(film)" cat="film">Intersection</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother" cat="">Motherhood</a>  and Politics ," Im often asked, So, how is the maternal political? I usually pause when confronted with this question not because I  <b>dont</b> have strong opinions on the subject, but because it still surprises me that this is a question we ask in our society. How is  <b>motherhood</b> political? It seems more reasonable to ask, How is it not? Because, of course, every act of mothering has a  <b>political dimension</b>. And every political act impacts every  <b>single mother</b>, because every act shapes the world in which our children live. Right now in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a> , political  <b>motherhood</b> is getting a  <b>tremendous</b> amount of press because  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republican</a>  VP candidate  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin" cat="person	member	writer	contestant	candidate	politician	analyst	convert	republican	councillor	woman	nominee	broadcaster	pundit	governor	announcer	evangelicals	mayor">Governor Sarah Palin</a>  is getting a lot of press. When she got off the plane in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri" cat="place	city	community">St. Louis</a>  last week for her debate against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden" cat="person	president	politician	player	candidate	senator	democrat	lawyer	recipient	scholar">Senator Joe Biden</a> , she held her baby son  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry" cat="invention">Trig</a>  in her arms. The media is  <b>fascinated</b> with her children, with how  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palin_Majere" cat="character">Palin</a>  manages (or doesnt manage) to do it all. Gone are the days when the acknowledgment of mothers in our political  <b>landscape</b> was a token nod to  <b>soccer moms</b> or security moms. Today, we have the  <b>hockey mom</b>, who  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gop" cat="mountain	site">the GOP</a>  would like us mothers to think of as our  <b>peer</b>, our voice.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother" cat="">Motherhood</a>  has arrived on the political stage! But for me, getting a mom into office, while desirable, was never the point. I had hoped that having a mom on the ticket (I presumed months ago, that this would be  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton" cat="person	senator	lawyer	alumnus	activist	woman	democrat	feminist	member	republican	methodists	writer	memoirists	president	candidate	winner	scholar	secretary	minister">Hillary Clinton</a> ) would bring mothers interests into clear focus in this  <b>presidential election</b>. But despite all the recent attention given to a small  <b>town</b> mom from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasilla,_Alaska" cat="place	city">Wasilla</a> , this hardly seems the case. The candidates speak in generalities about  <b>health care reform</b> and  <b>education</b>, but the moms I know are  <b>looking</b> for specific, impassioned answers about what McCain/Palin or Obama/Biden will do for our children. So as we move into the final weeks of the election, Ill be listening for details, and watching carefully to see what the candidates have to say about the issues at the top of my list:  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" cat="country	territory	dispute	republic	state">Afghanistan</a> , the  <b>economy</b>,  <b>reproductive rights</b>,  <b>health care</b>, and education. <br>
