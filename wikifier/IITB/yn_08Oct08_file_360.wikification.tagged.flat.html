Help UPDATE:Libya Oil Chief:Output Must Fall If  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_Drop" cat="">Price Drop</a>  Runs On  <b>23 hours</b> ago (Adds details.)  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_postal_district" cat="list">LONDON</a>  (AFP)--Libya's energy chief called Tuesday on the world's  <b>oil</b> producers to cut output to protect their incomes should crude prices continue to trade at current levels. "If the  <b>price level</b> continues as it is we are seriously thinking of cutting down our production and calling on other member countries in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC" cat="establishment	relations	economics	organization">OPEC</a> , and non-OPEC producing countries, to cut their production to safeguard their incomes,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shukri_Ghanem" cat="person	alumnus">Shukri Ghanem</a>  told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse" cat="agency	company	establishment">AFP</a>  by  <b>telephone</b>. "We are very much  <b>worried</b> about this drop in the price," said Ghanem, who is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya" cat="state	country">Libya</a> 's representative in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Organization" cat="">the Organization</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum" cat="oil	dispute">Petroleum</a>  Exporting Countries. "We will think that all producing countries should take a unified view and should try to do something to stop the deterioration of prices," said Ghanem, who is also chairman of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya" cat="state	country">Libyan</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oil_Corporation" cat="">National Oil Corporation</a> . Crude  <b>futures</b> rebounded by more than $2 a  <b>barrel</b> Tuesday, holding close to $90 a  <b>barrel</b>, on speculation that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC" cat="establishment	relations	economics	organization">OPEC</a>  could cut output to prevent the market falling further.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_(finance)" cat="">Traders</a>  said the market was also boosted by growing  <b>hopes</b> that the world's  <b>central banks</b> could cut their  <b>interest rates</b> in a bid to boost troubled  <b>financial markets</b>. The cost of  <b>crude oil</b> has plummeted by about 40% since striking record heights above $147 a  <b>barrel</b> in July, as the market has been dragged down by fears of weakening  <b>economic growth</b> and  <b>slowing</b> demand. Lower  <b>oil prices</b> translate into falling revenues for members of the 13-nation  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC" cat="establishment	relations	economics	organization">OPEC cartel</a> . Ghanem told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse" cat="agency	company	establishment">AFP</a>  that he would support an emergency meeting of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC" cat="establishment	relations	economics	organization">OPEC</a>   <b>oil</b> ministers to discuss the issue. "I will support the idea of an emergency meeting, but in the meantime we  <b>want to</b> see action," he said. In September,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC" cat="establishment	relations	economics	organization">OPEC</a>  decided to cut its production by 520,000  <b>barrels</b> a day to sustain  <b>oil prices</b> above $100 a  <b>barrel</b>. Ghanem's comments came one day after  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC" cat="establishment	relations	economics	organization">OPEC</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president" cat="occupation	president">Vice President</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galo_Chiriboga" cat="person	lawyer	minister">Galo Chiriboga</a> , who is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" cat="country	state	colony">Ecuador</a> 's  <b>oil</b>  <b>minister</b>, said the  <b>volatile</b> world  <b>financial markets</b> could affect  <b>oil prices</b> and force the  <b>cartel</b> to take action.
