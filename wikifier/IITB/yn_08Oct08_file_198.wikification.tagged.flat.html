Why hasn't Britt been found for  <b>heaven</b>'s  <b>sake</b>?" Those were the words of the mother of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne" cat="city	capital	place	area	festival">Melbourne</a>   <b>backpacker</b> Britt Lapthorne - missing in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" cat="state	republic	member	country">Croatia</a>  - who broke down in anger and in tears while describing her "living hell". Elke Lapthorne spoke to reporters from the family's two-acre property at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Park" cat="stadium	attraction	venue	grounds">Eden Park</a> , about 70km north of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_city_centre" cat="">Melbourne's CBD</a> , in the home where Britt grew up. She described the last few days as "bizarre" and "surreal" but her reality without Britt and her husband, Dale, and son, Darren, who are in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" cat="state	republic	member	country">Croatia</a>  looking for the 21-year-old  <b>backpacker</b> is a  <b>nightmare</b>. Britt Lapthorne was last seen in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik" cat="city	republic	place	site">Dubrovnik, Croatia</a> , in the  <b>early hours</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_18" cat="days">September 18</a> . A body was discovered in waters off the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_language" cat="language	dispute">Croatian</a>   <b>walled city</b> on Monday. It was heavily decomposed and  <b>police</b> do not believe it is that of the  <b>international relations</b>  <b>university student</b>. Her family expects to wait 10 days after Dale Lapthorne provided  <b>blood</b>  <b>samples</b> and Britt's  <b>dental records</b> to  <b>pathologists</b>, who will use  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" cat="">DNA</a>  analysis to identify the remains. "Last night I slept really well surprisingly, but I woke up a couple of times last night  <b>gasping</b> for  <b>breath</b> and I don't want to wake up (that way) any more," Mrs Lapthorne told reporters. "We live in this beautiful part of the countryside and Britt's had a lovely life. "It can't be happening to us ... what else are we going to find out? I feel totally drained." Mrs Lapthorne said her daughter was "just a normal girl, a beautiful girl". There has been daily media speculation about her wild partying in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" cat="concept">Europe</a> . "She was passionate about reading, loved her music and loved nothing better than coming home after work or uni, putting on an old dressing  <b>gown</b> hopping on to the  <b>couch</b> with me," Mrs Lapthorne said. "I wake up every morning with a  <b>glimmer</b> of hope that she is still alive."  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivica_KosteliÄ‡" cat="">Ivica</a>  Perkovic, the 33-year-old son of the owner of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik" cat="city	republic	place	site">Dubrovnik</a>   <b>hostel</b> where Britt stayed, has been questioned by  <b>police</b> but not charged. Mrs Lapthorne criticised the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Australia" cat="">Australian government</a>  and an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" cat="agency	entity">Australian Federal Police</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" cat="agency	entity">AFP</a> ) officer in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" cat="state	republic	member	country">Croatia</a>  as heartless. "He introduced himself as the 'phantom officer'," she said, implying that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" cat="agency	entity">AFP</a>  officer in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" cat="state	republic	member	country">Croatia</a>  had  <b>inappropriately</b> joked about being described as such by her husband, for not making contact with them for four days after arriving. The opposition wants more  <b>federal police</b> officers to be sent to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" cat="state	republic	member	country">Croatia</a>  to help with the investigation. "Reports that persons who may have material information to give to  <b>police</b> have left  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia" cat="state	republic	member	country">Croatia</a>  but have been located and interviewed by the media before official statements have been taken, are  <b>deeply</b> concerning," opposition  <b>foreign affairs</b> spokeswoman  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Coonan" cat="person	member">Helen Coonan</a>  said.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Australia)" cat="minister	politics">Foreign Minister</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smith_(Australian_politician)" cat="member	politician	minister	person	catholic">Stephen Smith</a>  said communications between the Lapthorne family and investigators would be improved and Mr Lapthorne and his son Darren would be given daily updates.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Associated_Press" cat="agency	establishment">AAP</a>  Ads from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!" cat="company	provider	property	engine">Yahoo</a> !
