Knopf</a> ,  <b>384</b> pages, $25. The  <b>literature</b> of human conflict divides itself into two schools: One the more ancient is bardic and celebrates war and warriors; the other is the tradition of witness, which elucidates war and records the fates of those caught up in it.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Filkins" cat="person	recipient	correspondent">Dexter Filkins</a>  brilliant new reportorial  <b>memoir</b>, " <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forever_War" cat="novel">The Forever War</a> ," deserves to be ranked as a classic of the latter  <b>genre</b> and is likely to be regarded as the definitive account of how the wars in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" cat="country	territory	dispute	republic	state">Afghanistan</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  were experienced by those who actually waged them.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filkins" cat="village">Filkins</a>  first went to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan" cat="country	territory	dispute	republic	state">Afghanistan</a>  in  <b>1998</b> as a  <b>reporter</b> for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" cat="newspaper	subsidiary	recipient">Los Angeles Times</a> . Two years later, he was arrested and expelled by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban" cat="controversy	supraorganizations	organization">the Taliban</a> .

His account of those years is utterly harrowing in its accumulation of detail. Rather than construct a synthetic  <b>narrative</b>, the  <b>author</b> has chosen to proceed from one meticulously constructed  <b>vignette</b> to another. The opening sequence, for example, is a stunning reconstruction of a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" cat="services	unit">Marine</a>  platoons first night in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallujah" cat="place">Fallujah</a>  that could stand as a  <b>pitch-perfect</b>  <b>evocation</b> of Carl von Clausewitzs infamous "fog of war."
