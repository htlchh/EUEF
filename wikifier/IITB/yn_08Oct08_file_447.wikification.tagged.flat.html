Alto Channel Samples up to 34.1 g/t (0.99 oz/ton) Gold at Greenoaks, Beardmore-Geraldton  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold" cat="material	metal	mineral	elements	conductor">Gold</a>  Belt,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario" cat="province	state">Ontario</a>  Tuesday September 30, 4:00 pm ET  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver" cat="place	city	settlement	game">VANCOUVER</a> , BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwire - Sept. 30, 2008) - Alto Ventures Ltd. ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange" cat="company	exchange">TSX</a>  VENTURE: - ) has received results from surface channel sampling completed on the Greenoaks Project in the Beardmore-Geraldton  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold" cat="material	metal	mineral	elements	conductor">Gold</a>  Belt.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold" cat="material	metal	mineral	elements	conductor">Gold</a>  values up to 34.16 grams per tonne (g/t) across 1.0  <b>metres</b> (m) were obtained from channel sampling along a northwest trending structure consisting of shears and fractures. This structure has been traced by mechanical stripping for 500 m along  <b>strike</b> (see Alto  <b>news release</b> dated July 24, 2008) and the current program sampled 180 m of  <b>strike</b> length to the northwest of the former Greenoaks Mine. In addition, channel sampling across a newly exposed  <b>vein</b>  <b>50 m</b> southeast of the Greenoaks Mine returned up to 3.74 g/t gold across  <b>0.9</b> m. The former Greenoaks Mine is reported to have produced 1,171 tons of vein material at an average grade of 6.1 g/t gold and an additional 53 tons averaging 17.1 g/t gold. The table below lists the channel samples assaying greater than 1 g/t gold.

The channels are cut continuously across the width of the  <b>sample</b> with a motorized saw using a  <b>diamond</b> saw  <b>blade</b> to a depth of 10 cm and then the cut  <b>rock</b> is chipped out with  <b>hammer</b> and chisel. The  <b>samples</b> are described by Alto  <b>geologists</b> noting rocks types and mineralization and then bagged for delivery to the  <b>assay</b>  <b>laboratory</b> for quantitative analyses for  <b>gold</b> and selected elements.

Each of the samples reported here was assayed using  <b>pulp</b> metallic assaying method for  <b>gold</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(band)" cat="group	quintet">Pulp</a>  metallic analyses involves the crushing of the entire  <b>sample</b> to 90% -8 mesh and using a Jones  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(tool)" cat="tool">Riffler</a>  to split the  <b>sample</b> to a 1 kg sub-sample. The entire sub-sample is pulverized to approximately 90% -150 mesh and subsequently sieved through a 150-mesh screen.
