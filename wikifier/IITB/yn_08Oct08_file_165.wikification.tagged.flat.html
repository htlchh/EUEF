"I don’t know when it became vogue to put fear into the voting process, except if you don’t want people to vote,"  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunner,_New_Zealand" cat="place">Brunner</a> , a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrat</a> , said. Her office must respond to the complaint by Wednesday.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republicans</a>  said there’s no process to make sure voters aren’t casting ballots using false registration information. In the complaint, the party cites unverified reports of individuals coming from out-of-state to cast ballots during  <b>early voting</b>. Brunner’s office said that in cases where people registered and then immediately voted, the registration information was fed into a  <b>database</b> that will  <b>decide</b> whether an address is valid.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunner,_New_Zealand" cat="place">Brunner</a>  said there have been only a handful of documented cases of actual  <b>voter fraud</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" cat="state">Ohio</a> , and that other safeguards are in place to catch  <b>fraud</b> in the state’s bipartisan system. When registering, voters must provide name, address, date of birth, and either their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number" cat="identifier	numbers	state">Social Security number</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunner,_New_Zealand" cat="place">Brunner</a>  said the  <b>state</b> already matches registration information against data in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau" cat="group">the Bureau</a>  of Motor Vehicles system, as well as the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)" cat="state">Social Security</a>   <b>database</b>. She said  <b>federal law</b> provides no requirements of what to do once a mismatch is discovered. It is up to counties to check the system for flagged registrations, and then investigate if warranted. In its complaint,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gop" cat="mountain	site">the GOP</a>  asked  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court" cat="court">U.S. District Court</a>  Judge George Smith to require  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunner,_New_Zealand" cat="place">Brunner</a>  to check all registrations that came in either on or after Jan. 1, 2008, something Brunner’s office says the  <b>database</b> has been doing almost instantaneously with all new registrations. ___ Information from:  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Columbus_Dispatch" cat="newspaper">The Columbus Dispatch</a> , http://www.dispatch.com ©  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" cat="record	economics">Copyright</a>   <b>2008</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" cat="cooperative	agency	establishment	medium	recipient">Associated Press</a> .
