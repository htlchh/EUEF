   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">NEW YORK</a>  (AP) _ The price of a  <b>college degree</b> continues to rise faster than  <b>inflation</b>, with  <b>tuition</b> and fees at public four-year colleges up an average 4.4 percent this fall, even more at private schools, a new survey has found. And loans provide a growing chunk of the extra money students  <b>need to</b> pay for those degrees.   Average in-state  <b>tuition</b> and fees at public, four-year schools is $3,510 per  <b>semester</b> _ $148 more than last year, according to figures released Monday by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board" cat="association	test">College Board</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus" cat="university">On-campus</a>   <b>room and board</b> now averages $4,960, up 5.1 percent.   At private four-year colleges, tuition and fees average $16,332, up 5.2 percent from last year.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_and_board" cat="">Room and board</a>  on campus is now $6,209, a 4.2 percent increase.   Only public two-year schools, chiefly  <b>community colleges</b>, stayed below the current  <b>inflation rate</b> _ but barely.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuition" cat="">Tuition</a>  rose this year to $1,705, up 3.4 percent, the survey found.   Private two-year schools boosted  <b>tuition</b> and fees to $7,458, a 7 percent rise.   This pattern follows an old, familiar trend, said Joni Finney, a  <b>policy analyst</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Public_Policy_and_Higher_Education" cat="">National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California" cat="city	place	seats	capital">San Jose</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" cat="state	colony">Calif</a> . ``Colleges and  <b>universities</b> have a very difficult time controlling their costs,'' she said.   ``These institutions were  <b>underfunded</b> in the early part of the '90s,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finney_County,_Kansas" cat="establishment	county">Finney</a>  said. ''... But they've more than made up for  <b>lost ground</b>.''   But Stanley Eikenberry, president of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_on_Education" cat="organization">American Council on Education</a> , an  <b>umbrella group</b> for  <b>higher education</b>, said in a statement, ``Given the large, fixed costs of most campuses, in personnel and facilities especially, these numbers show institutions are working hard to hold the line on increases.''   The recent increases push past  <b>inflation</b>. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index" cat="index">Consumer Price Index</a>  rose 2.7 percent in  <b>1999</b>; the first eight months of this year,  <b>consumer prices</b> rose at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. Last year,  <b>college tuition</b> and fees rose less than 5 percent.   Despite the increases,  <b>college</b> remains affordable and a good investment, said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board" cat="association	test">College Board</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President" cat="occupation	executive	title	president	position">President</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Caperton" cat="businesspeople	person	episcopalian	democrat">Gaston Caperton</a>  in a statement with the surveys. ``In both earning potential and learning potential, you cannot beat the value of a  <b>college</b>  <b>education</b>,'' the former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_West_Virginia" cat="list	politics">West Virginia governor</a>  said.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board" cat="association	test">The College Board</a> 's figures concern the costs for 6.4 million full-time  <b>undergraduates</b> _ 54 percent attending four-year public institutions, 27 percent at four-year private schools, 17 percent at two-year  <b>community colleges</b> and 1 percent at private two-year schools.   A majority of students need grants or loans _ or both _ but their exact numbers are unknown, a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board" cat="association	test">College Board</a>  spokesman said.   Last school year, loans made up 59 percent of a record $68 billion in  <b>financial aid</b>. A decade ago, loans made up just over 41 percent of student financial help.   The pool of money from federal, state and school sources last year was 4 percent greater than a year earlier, but 88 percent more than a decade before, taking  <b>inflation</b> into account.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_on_the_Bright_Lights" cat="album">The New</a>  York-based  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board" cat="association	test">College Board</a>  is a  <b>nonprofit organization</b> that administers  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saturdays" cat="group	artist">the SATs</a>  and promotes  <b>higher education</b>.
