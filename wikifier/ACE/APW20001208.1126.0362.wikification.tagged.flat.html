   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow" cat="city	list	establishment	capital">MOSCOW</a>  (AP) _  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language" cat="language">Russian</a>  lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Anthem_of_the_Soviet_Union" cat="symbol	song">Soviet anthem</a>  as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a> 's  <b>national hymn</b> _ a move praised by some as a gesture of reconciliation and denounced by others as a symbolic approval of the nation's  <b>totalitarian</b> past.   The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma" cat="establishment	house">State Duma</a> , or  <b>lower house</b> of  <b>parliament</b>, voted 381-51 to  <b>approve</b> the bill, which was strongly backed by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="christian	politician	personnel	person	president	officer	angel	practitioner	director	alumnus">President Vladimir Putin</a> . The move restored the  <b>old anthem</b>'s music by  <b>composer</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Vasilyevich_Alexandrov" cat="person	composer	writer">Alexander Alexandrov</a>  but not the original text that included praise for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union" cat="">Communist leaders</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" cat="person	activist	leaders	communist	atheist	burial	survivor	scholar	philosopher	theorist	revolutionary	politician	mummy	member	russian	alumnus	lawyer	economist	christian">Vladimir Lenin</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" cat="politician	perpetrator	anti	person	christian	leaders	survivor	marshals	communist	theorist	activist	recipient	atheist">Josef Stalin</a> .   By the same strong majority, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma" cat="legislature	loanword">Duma</a>  approved  <b>legislation</b> formally endorsing the country's current white-red-and-blue  <b>flag</b> as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a> 's official  <b>flag</b>. That  <b>legislation</b> also brings back the Soviet-era  <b>red banner</b> as the military's  <b>flag</b> and retains the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar" cat="title	loanword	leaders">Czarist</a>   <b>double-headed</b> eagle as the  <b>state emblem</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="christian	politician	personnel	person	president	officer	angel	practitioner	director	alumnus">Putin</a>  has said the mixture of old  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language" cat="language">Russian</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" cat="federation	disestablishment	state	country	republic	polity">Soviet</a>  symbols would  <b>mend</b> bitter rifts in society by paying tribute to the positive heritage of both periods. He referred to  <b>opinion polls</b> showing that most people prefer  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Vasilyevich_Alexandrov" cat="person	composer	writer">Alexandrov</a> 's music to a  <b>melody</b> by 19th-century  <b>composer</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Glinka" cat="person	composer">Mikhail Glinka</a> , which has been  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" cat="country	nation	republic	state">Russia</a> 's  <b>anthem</b> since the  <b>1991</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1985â€“1991)" cat="">Soviet collapse</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy" cat="form	election">Liberal politicians</a>  and many leading cultural figures have strongly opposed the  <b>reinstatement</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Anthem_of_the_Soviet_Union" cat="symbol	song">Soviet anthem</a> , saying it symbolized  <b>political repression</b>.   ``We strongly protest against the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism" cat="politics">Stalinist</a>   <b>anthem</b>, which is stained by the  <b>blood</b> of millions of victims,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Yavlinsky" cat="person	member">Grigory Yavlinsky</a> , the head of the  <b>liberal</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yabloko" cat="party">Yabloko</a>  faction.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yabloko" cat="party">Yabloko</a>  and another  <b>liberal faction</b>, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Right_Forces" cat="party">Union of Right Forces</a> , said they might appeal Friday's vote in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_the_Russian_Federation" cat="">Constitutional Court</a> . The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma" cat="legislature	loanword">Duma</a>  usually hears speeches by faction leaders before a vote, but this time lawmakers skipped the debate _ a move the  <b>liberals</b> described as a  <b>procedural</b> violation.   ``For the first time, the opposition was refused the right to speak out,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Yavlinsky" cat="person	member">Yavlinsky</a>  said. ``The presidential administration and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" cat="ideology">Communists</a>  were afraid of our arguments against the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Anthem_of_the_Soviet_Union" cat="symbol	song">Soviet anthem</a> .''   Former President  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin" cat="recipient	person	president	leaders	convert	minister	politician">Boris Yeltsin</a>  has joined other critics of the move to restore the  <b>anthem</b>. He said in an interview published Friday in the daily  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komsomolskaya_Pravda" cat="newspaper	medium">Komsomolskaya Pravda</a>  that the solemn music recalls  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" cat="party	politics">Communist Party</a>  congresses, not  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Sports" cat="">Soviet sports</a>  victories and achievements in space, as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="christian	politician	personnel	person	president	officer	angel	practitioner	director	alumnus">Putin</a>  had said.   ``I'm categorically against the restoration of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Anthem_of_the_Soviet_Union" cat="symbol	song">Soviet anthem</a> ,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin" cat="recipient	person	president	leaders	convert	minister	politician">Yeltsin</a>  said.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" cat="ideology">Communists</a>  and other hard-liners had opposed the  <b>tricolor flag</b> and the  <b>eagle</b> as a vestige of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Czars" cat="group">the Czars</a> , forcing  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin" cat="recipient	person	president	leaders	convert	minister	politician">Yeltsin</a>  to  <b>approve</b> them by  <b>decree</b>. But they agreed to abandon their criticism and back formal approval for the symbols in response to the reintroduction of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Anthem_of_the_Soviet_Union" cat="symbol	song">Soviet anthem</a> .   No conclusive version of new lyrics for the old music has been approved yet. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma" cat="legislature	loanword">Duma</a>  asked  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" cat="christian	politician	personnel	person	president	officer	angel	practitioner	director	alumnus">Putin</a>  to set up a panel to consider the text and submit the final version for its approval.   During Friday's debate,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma" cat="legislature	loanword">Duma</a>  speaker  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennadiy_Seleznyov" cat="person	communist	member">Gennady Seleznyov</a>  said officials had received an anonymous  <b>telephone call</b> saying a  <b>bomb</b> had been planted in the building.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator" cat="legislator	legislature	profession	occupation">Lawmakers</a>  ignored it and continued their session as  <b>police</b> officers with sniffer dogs searched the premises.  <br>
