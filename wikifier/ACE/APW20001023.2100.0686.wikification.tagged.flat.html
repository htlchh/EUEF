   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littleton,_Colorado" cat="seats	city">LITTLETON</a> , Colo. (AP) _ The wife of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Roy" cat="person	player	champion	pick	winner	star	alumnus	sportspeople	personnel">Patrick Roy</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League" cat="league">NHL</a> 's winningest goalie, called  <b>911</b> because she was afraid of what her husband would do as they argued about in-laws, according to a  <b>police report</b> released Monday.   Michele Roy was not hurt during the dispute at their home early Sunday, but Roy admitted pulling a bedroom door off its hinges and damaging another after his wife called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Village,_Colorado" cat="">Greenwood Village</a>   <b>police</b> and hung up without speaking, the report said.   The  <b>somber</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche" cat="club	team">Colorado Avalanche</a>  goalie, accompanied by his parents, sister and brother, stood with his hands clasped behind his back during a brief court appearance.   The initial hearing was postponed until Nov. 7. Roy remained free on a $750  <b>bail</b> and left by a side door without comment. His wife was absent.   The  <b>judge</b> also issued a  <b>restraining order</b> that is standard in  <b>domestic-dispute</b> cases, which requires Roy to  <b>refrain</b> from  <b>alcohol</b> and  <b>illegal drugs</b> and possession of guns or weapons. He was permitted to return home to his family and is allowed to travel with the team to out-of-state games.   After  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avalanche_(album)" cat="">the Avalanche</a> 's practice, Roy read a brief statement, noting that he could not comment on his arrest on the advice of his  <b>lawyer</b>. He also asked that the public respect his family's  <b>privacy</b>.   ``Obviously, this is creating a distraction, and my wish is that this distraction will be over soon,'' he said. ``I am thankful for the support I am getting from my family and every one of my teammates.''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado" cat="state">Colorado</a>  players showed unified support for Roy, saying they believe he will remain focused after an eight-game (6-0-2) unbeaten streak to start the season. The team's next game is at home Wednesday against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee" cat="city	seats	county	place">Nashville</a> .   ``We <b>'ve</b> always  <b>stuck</b> together and we'll stick by Patrick,''  <b>defenseman</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bourque" cat="person	player	winner	quebecers	pick	captain	personnel	defencemen	alumnus	recipient	star	champion">Ray Bourque</a>  said. ``We know he is a quality person and a great family man.''   Defenseman  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Miller" cat="player	men	defencemen	person	pick	medalist">Aaron Miller</a>  said, ``Until we find out exactly what's going on, we're not going to let it bother us or distract us. I think I speak for the whole team that we're behind Patty 100 percent.''   Roy, 35, was arrested and charged Sunday with  <b>misdemeanor</b>  <b>criminal mischief</b> which occurred during an act of  <b>domestic violence</b>.   If convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in the  <b>county jail</b> and a $1,000 fine, said a spokesman for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapahoe_County,_Colorado" cat="county	establishment">Arapahoe County</a>   <b>district attorney</b>'s office.   Officers responded to the 911 hang-up call at Roy's residence, where Michele Roy told them the two had been arguing.   Roy was honored Friday night for winning his 448th game three days before, a 4-3 victory in  <b>overtime</b> against the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals" cat="sport	club	capital">Washington Capitals</a> . He broke the mark set by Terry Sawchuk.  <br>
