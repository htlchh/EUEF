   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas" cat="place	city">ARLINGTON, Texas</a>  (AP) _ One of  <b>baseball</b>'s biggest  <b>free-agent</b> prizes,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez" cat="champion	winner	player	drug	person	basemen	case	sportspeople	star">Alex Rodriguez</a>  is getting  <b>red-carpet</b> treatment from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)" cat="team	club	sport	ranger	company">Texas Rangers</a> .   And even the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars" cat="club	team">Dallas Stars</a>  are lending a hand in trying to win over the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" cat="game">All-Star</a>   <b>shortstop</b>.   Rodriguez and agent  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Boras" cat="lawyer	person	company	agent	dispute">Scott Boras</a>  were expected to meet Monday with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)" cat="team	club	sport	ranger	company">Rangers</a>  owner  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hicks" cat="person	owner	executive	chairman	billionaire	champion">Tom Hicks</a> . He will be joined by  <b>general manager</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Melvin" cat="person	executive	director	manager">Doug Melvin</a> ,  <b>manager</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Oates" cat="person	manager	coach	player	alumnus	catcher	christian">Johnny Oates</a>  and several players.   The team's bid for Rodriguez hasn't been slowed by the expected demand of at least a 10-year contract, in the range of $20 million a year, loaded with  <b>fringe benefits</b>.   ``We feel at the expense of last year, we have our roster where we don't have to trade people to make this work,'' Melvin said in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram" cat="newspaper	publication">the Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>  on Monday. ``I <b>'m</b> not saying we have all the money in the world, but we don't have to  <b>bust</b> our budget completely. We're in a better position than most other clubs.''   Stars center  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Modano" cat="player	sportspeople	person	pick	champion	christian	medalist	personnel	star	catholic	alumnus">Mike Modano</a>  is being called in to help show Rodriguez around the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallasâ€“Fort_Worth_Metroplex" cat="">Dallas-Fort Worth area</a>  and tell him why it would be a great place to play.   Melvin said he doesn't expect the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C." cat="club	team	company	dispute">Rangers</a>  to make a formal offer until they can gauge the level of interest from Rodriguez.   The 25-year-old  <b>shortstop</b>, who hit .316 with 41 homers and 132  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in" cat="statistics">RBIs</a>  at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners" cat="team	sport	club">Seattle</a>  last season, also reportedly has been targeted by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox" cat="team	sox	club">Chicago White Sox</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers" cat="club	team">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets" cat="team	club">New York Mets</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves" cat="team	sport	brave	subsidiary	club">Atlanta Braves</a> .   The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners" cat="team	sport	club">Mariners</a> , Rodriguez's team the past six years, also wanted to re-sign him.   ``This gives us a chance to tell him about our organization and the direction we're going, answer any questions they might have about us,'' Melvin said.   Some even have a  <b>neighborhood</b> _ the fashionable  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas,_Texas" cat="">Dallas</a>   <b>suburb</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Park,_Texas" cat="">Highland Park</a>  _ picked out for Rodriguez. Neighbors of one available residence _ a five-bedroom spread worth $11.95 million _ would include Hicks, Modano and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys" cat="team	cowboy	sport	club">Dallas Cowboys</a>  owner  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones" cat="president	person	executive	billionaire	linemen	player	sportspeople	owner	republican	manager">Jerry Jones</a> .   ``Alex needs to buy this house,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronda" cat="municipality">Ronda</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needham,_Massachusetts" cat="place	establishment">Needham</a> , a  <b>listing agent</b>, told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News" cat="newspaper	recipient">The Dallas Morning News</a> . ``The people who own this house set it up around their two baseball-playing sons. It's a very sports-minded house.''   The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets" cat="team	club">Mets</a> , once considered the favorites to get Rodriguez, have slowed their chase.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager" cat="occupation">General manager</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Phillips" cat="person	announcer	executive	manager">Steve Phillips</a>  publicly criticized some of the demands supposedly made by Boras. But the agent says Rodriguez is making no special demands.   ``I can't anticipate any change that would draw us back into it,'' Phillips said.  <br>
