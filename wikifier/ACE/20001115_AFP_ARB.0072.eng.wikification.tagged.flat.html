This compensates for any loss in buying and selling in  <b>euros</b> rather than dollars."    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  decided to deal in  <b>euros</b>, rather than the  <b>dollar</b>, as of the sixth of this month for its  <b>oil</b> sales and outside trade deals. <br>
