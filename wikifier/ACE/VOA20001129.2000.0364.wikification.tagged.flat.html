 Welcome to this hour of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America" cat="organization	winner	organisation	services">VOA News</a>  Now. I'm  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin,_Wisconsin" cat="">Erin</a>  Brumett in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a> . The incredibly close  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Florida,_2000" cat="controversy">Florida vote</a>  count for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" cat="president">President</a>  is in the  <b>state</b> courts and heading for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">US Supreme Court</a>  at the end of the week. That's virtually  <b>unprecedented</b>, as the Federal Courts have tended to stay out of  <b>elections</b>, which are the responsibility of the states. Joe O'Grossman is a  <b>professor</b> of  <b>constitutional law</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland" cat="">Baltimore</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University" cat="institution	university	contractor">Johns Hopkins University</a> . He says that in this instance the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  probably felt the circumstances were such that they had no  <b>real alternative</b> but to take the case.   Well, I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try to reject it out of hand. In fact, I think that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Tribe" cat="alumnus	scholar	lawyer	person	writer	clerk">Lawrence Tribe</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Law_School" cat="dispute	university	school	institution">Harvard Law School</a>  Professor who is arguing for Gore tomorrow, is going to ask the court to hold the case,  <b>moot</b> and dismiss it. And the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_presidential_campaign,_2004" cat="campaign">Bush campaign</a>  has brought the case, but recognizes that the particular issues that they brought to the court last week are really not very relevant anymore. They are going to probably, well, I know what they are going to do. They are going to try to broaden the case to make it a kind of a general  <b>referendum</b> on  <b>election procedures</b>. So, they are  <b>looking</b> for a  <b>coronation</b>. And the Gore people at this point just  <b>want to</b> get rid of this case, because they think they have a better chance in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_Florida" cat="court">Florida courts</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republicans</a>  generally support states' rights. So, does it appear  <b>somewhat</b>  <b>ironic</b> that they are going to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  in this instance?   No, I think first of all the notion that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republicans</a>  favor states' rights and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrats</a>  oppose it, is much too simplistic. That's generally true, but it's only true on some issues. And in this case, you could argue that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushmen" cat="peoples	nomad	group">Bush people</a>  are going to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  to preserve the right of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a> , to determine its own electors. So, there is a kind of states' rights issue there. But they need, or at least they once thought they needed the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  to endorse it. So it goes both ways.   What are the justices likely  <b>looking</b> for?   Well, I don't know. But I think that - and I think they will be divided, I mean I don't think they will be unanimous. Obviously, they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the case.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States" cat="election">American election</a>  laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in the Federal courts, but this is certainly the first time we have had a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  challenge over presidential election. So, there is a lot of new  <b>law</b> here to be made or at least  <b>law</b> that hasn't been made yet. It's possible that if the court accepts the invitation of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_presidential_campaign,_2004" cat="campaign">Bush campaign</a> , at least as it is expressed in the  <b>briefs</b> they submitted yesterday, that the court will in the sense, take the entire issue, even - not just the specific questions that it was asked last week and try to resolve the question. For example, if the court says it is clearly the fact that the legislature of the  <b>state</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a>  can determine for itself who its electors will be, that will pretty much end the case, because that's what the  <b>legislature</b> already plans to do. And that doesn't mean the Gore people won't keep trying, because ultimately  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" cat="legislature	establishment">Congress</a>  has to  <b>decide</b> and only  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" cat="legislature	establishment">Congress</a>  can  <b>decide</b> if there are competing slates of electors submitted, which  <b>slate</b> to accept.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University" cat="institution	university	contractor">The Johns Hopkins University</a>   <b>constitutional law</b>  <b>professor</b> Joe O'Grossman says, it's still not certain the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  will actually hear the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a>  case. As their first order, business Friday, attorneys for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Vice President Gore</a>  will move to have the court dismiss the case brought by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republican</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">George W Bush</a> .  <br>
