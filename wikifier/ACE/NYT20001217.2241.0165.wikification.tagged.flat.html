Times News Service</a>  &QC; &LR; &QL;    Booking Your Ticket:   _ Fly nonstop. The fewer connections you make, the lower the chance that you will suffer a delay.   _ Pick  <b>airports</b> with care. If you have to connect, choose the least-congested  <b>airport</b> possible; some  <b>airports</b>, like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Hare_International_Airport" cat="airport	airfield	establishment">Chicago O'Hare</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport" cat="airfield	building	airport">La Guardia</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> , experience chronic delays. Take into consideration the weather and the season; an  <b>airport</b> in the South might have fewer winter snowstorms but more spring and summer thunderstorms.   _ Check times between connecting flights. Airlines often book tight connections and do not take responsibility if you miss yours. Assume each leg of your flight will  <b>arrive</b> late, and book connections that allow ample time.   _ Check  <b>on-time</b> records. The Transportation Department requires major domestic airlines to make the  <b>on-time</b> record for every flight available to consumers. You can check online at www.dot.gov/airconsumer. That site also reports each  <b>airline</b>'s  <b>on-time</b> record for the previous month.   _ Travel on off-peak days and at off-peak times. Saturday is usually the least-traveled day of the week; so are major holidays.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Mornings" cat="">Monday mornings</a>  and Friday  <b>afternoons</b> are  <b>peak travel times</b> for business travelers. Flights leaving earlier in the day are less likely to be delayed, because of the  <b>cascading effect</b> that disruptions have on airline schedules.   _ Use smaller airports. Instead of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport" cat="airfield	airport	establishment">Los Angeles International</a> , for example, consider flying into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope_Airport" cat="airport	establishment	airfield">Burbank</a>  or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Airport" cat="airfield	airport	building">John Wayne Airport</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California" cat="county	unit">Orange County</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" cat="state	colony">Calif.</a> , or use  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County_Airport" cat="airport	building">Westchester County Airport</a>  instead of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport" cat="building	airport">JFK</a>  in New York.   _ Avoid electronic tickets. Though they are convenient and more secure than an easily lost  <b>paper ticket</b>, they are not transferable between most airlines if you  <b>need to</b> switch carriers because of delays.   _ Watch for labor disruptions. Check newspapers and Web sites like www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com to identify airlines experiencing labor strife, which often increases cancellations and delays.   _ Leave a number. Make sure the  <b>airline</b> you book with has a  <b>phone number</b> at which you can be  <b>notified</b> of delays or cancellations.   _ Use a  <b>travel agent</b>. A good one can be a great ally in the event of a problem _ and may save you time and money.   Day of Departure:   _ Be informed. Check your flight's status before heading to the  <b>airport</b>. Automated  <b>telephone</b> services or  <b>airline</b> Web sites often provide more  <b>up-to-date</b> information than do ticket agents.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federal_Kuala_Lumpur" cat="building	hotel	skyscraper">The Federal</a>  Aviation Administration's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" cat="website">Web site</a> , www.fly.faa.gov, has  <b>real-time information</b> on operations at the biggest airports.   _ Pack defensively. Take along a change of clothes and a  <b>toothbrush</b> in your carry-on bag. If traveling with an  <b>infant</b>, take 24 hours' worth of  <b>diapers</b> and extra formula. When possible, avoid checking  <b>luggage</b>, in case you  <b>need to</b> switch flights or carriers. Ship your gifts ahead.   _ Educate yourself. Find out what your  <b>airline</b> promises to do for passengers in the event of a delay. Print out a copy of the policy from the  <b>airline</b>'s  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" cat="website">Web site</a> , and carry it with you _ in case the  <b>airline</b> representatives need a reminder.   If a Flight Is Delayed:   _ Keep your cool. Becoming angry at  <b>airline</b> personnel is counterproductive.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy" cat="loanword">Sympathy</a>  for their plight will sometimes produce results.   _ Don't stand in line. To get on another flight, it is often more effective to call the  <b>airline</b> from the  <b>airport</b> than to wait at the ticket counter. Carry a  <b>cell phone</b>; if delays are widespread,  <b>public telephones</b> may be in demand.   _ Check the competition. If another  <b>airline</b> has seats to your destination, ask your  <b>airline</b> to endorse your ticket to the other line.   _ Get what you paid for. If you paid full fare or are a  <b>high-mileage</b>  <b>frequent flier</b>, let the  <b>airline</b> know. Your odds of getting a seat on the next flight out will increase, or the  <b>airline</b> might pay for your  <b>hotel</b>, if you are delayed overnight.   _ Consider driving. If the last leg of your flight is a 200-mile hop, renting a car might be a better choice than waiting out a delay.   Getting Even:   _ Write a letter. The airlines have pledged to respond to consumer complaints within 60 days. They almost always offer a refund, reimbursement of expenses, a discount on your next ticket _ or all three. Be sure to save the relevant paperwork.   _ Make it a federal case. Send a copy of your letter to Washington. Complaints are charged against each  <b>airline</b> in the Transportation Department's monthly  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel" cat="">Air Travel</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Reports" cat="dispute	magazine	organization	guide">Consumer Report</a>  and serve as a basis for  <b>rule making</b> and enforcement action.
