Its dinners feature  <b>parodies</b> of  <b>politics</b> and government, and humorous speeches by political figures.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts,_Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Watts</a>  noted that the  <b>presidential election</b> of  <b>1876</b> was so disputed that a  <b>congressional commission</b> was created to settle it. ``I didn't know this until  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond" cat="schoolteacher	senator	recipient	person	democrat	centenarian	candidate	president	personnel	lawyer	judges	general	baptists	alumnus">Strom Thurmond</a>  told me he cast the deciding vote.   `` <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond" cat="schoolteacher	senator	recipient	person	democrat	centenarian	candidate	president	personnel	lawyer	judges	general	baptists	alumnus">Strom</a>  will be 98 next Tuesday,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts,_Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Watts</a>  said. ``Of course, he was only 67 when the recount of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a>  ballots began.''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts,_Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Watts</a>  said he had fond memories of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a>  because he was the  <b>quarterback</b> when the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma" cat="university	institution">University of Oklahoma</a>  won  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Bowl" cat="">the Orange Bowl</a>  there in  <b>1980</b> and  <b>1981</b>. ``But our victory in '81 was by a single point and it was weeks before it was confirmed,'' he said. ``By the way, I recently learned  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Al Gore</a>  was pulling for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University" cat="university	institution">Florida State</a>  and demanded a recount.''   As is traditional in Gridiron speeches,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts,_Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">Watts</a>  concluded on a serious note. ``Once-in-a-century oddities may leave an election result up in the air for a time, but the fundamental strength of our democracy is never in doubt,'' he said.   ``Better a process driven by an army of lawyers than an outrage led by an army with guns,'' he said.  <br>
