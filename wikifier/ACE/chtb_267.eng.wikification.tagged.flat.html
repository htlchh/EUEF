Aixing Dan,  <b>director</b> of the International Co-operation Department of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_power_industry" cat="">Electric Power Industry</a>  Ministry, on this matter, expressed to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency" cat="services	establishment	politics	agency">Xinhua News Agency</a>  reporters today that if this  <b>power plant</b> is successful, it will be a  <b>model</b> for similar plants to be built along coastal regions.   Coal, water, oil, etc., are normally used for traditional  <b>electricity generation</b>.  However, using liquefied  <b>natural gas</b> as fuel for joint  <b>circulatory</b>  <b>electricity generation</b> has advantages of higher  <b>power generation</b> efficiency and lower total cost, is beneficial to the environment, etc.  According to presentations, with this type of  <b>electricity generation</b> method, a single  <b>engine</b> with  <b>liquefied natural gas</b> as fuel can produce waste  <b>gas</b> with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade. This  <b>gas</b> in turn can  <b>heat</b> a  <b>boiler</b> for the production of  <b>steam</b> to turn a  <b>steam turbine</b> which generates  <b>electricity</b>.  Because of the efficiency of this construction method, the  <b>electricity</b> generated is relatively competitive in price.  At the same time, using  <b>natural gas</b> as fuel will also reduce  <b>environmental pollution</b> along coastal regions.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir_Group" cat="company">The Weir Group</a> , whose headquarters is in the US, is a large, specialized corporation investing in the area of  <b>electricity generation</b>.  The  <b>installed capacity</b> of  <b>electricity</b> it has invested in and developed globally has  <b>reached</b> 15 million  <b>kilowatts</b>.  Through the contact of the Yizhong Company of the US, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir_Group" cat="company">Weir Group</a>  and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu" cat="province">Jiangsu</a>  Electric Power Department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint  <b>circulatory</b>  <b>electricity generation</b> plant.  This  <b>power plant</b>, which will be situated in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudong_County" cat="division">Rudong</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu" cat="province">Jiangsu</a> , has an annual generation capacity of 2.4 million  <b>kilowatts</b>. The investment amount is 2.4 billion  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" cat="currency	dispute">US dollars</a> . The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language" cat="language">Chinese</a>  side holds 30% of the shares while the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir_Group" cat="company">Weir Group</a>  holds 70%.  According to the agreement, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir_Group" cat="company">Weir Group</a>  will be responsible for the supply of  <b>natural gas</b> from the international market for use by the  <b>power plant</b>.   Renzu Luo,  <b>managing director</b> of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir_Group" cat="company">Weir Group</a> , is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied  <b>natural gas</b> as fuel for  <b>electricity generation</b> along  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" cat="peoples	civilization	region">China</a> 's coastal regions.  He holds that according to the experience of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_Census" cat="group	demographic">Asian</a>   <b>energy market</b> development, liquefied  <b>natural gas</b> has become the main material of  <b>clean fuel</b> used for  <b>electricity generation</b>. When the  <b>gross national product</b> per capita reached 3000  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" cat="currency	dispute">US dollars</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" cat="country	state	nation	empire">Japan</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" cat="country	republic	state	region	nation">South Korea</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" cat="dispute	island">Taiwan</a> , etc.,  <b>environmental protection</b> awareness generally rose, and all began to  <b>obviously</b> increase usage of  <b>electricity</b> generated by  <b>liquefied natural gas</b>.  As the  <b>gross national product</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" cat="peoples	civilization	region">China</a> 's coastal regions begins to approach this benchmark, it can be  <b>said to</b> have had the conditions for  <b>electricity generation</b> using  <b>natural gas</b> in terms of financial resources.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Weir" cat="recipient	person	doctor">John Weir</a> , president of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weir_Group" cat="company">Weir Group</a>  who visited  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" cat="peoples	civilization	region">China</a>  with US Minister Brown and signed this agreement for  <b>electricity generation</b> plant construction in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangsu" cat="province">Jiangsu</a> , held that now is the  <b>best time</b> to develop a project of joint  <b>circulatory</b>  <b>electricity generation</b> plant with  <b>natural gas</b> as fuel in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" cat="peoples	civilization	region">China</a> . Both parties, the US and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" cat="peoples	civilization	region">China</a> , will invest more time, money and resources to make this  <b>power plant</b> project a successful model.
