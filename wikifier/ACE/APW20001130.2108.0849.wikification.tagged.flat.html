It became  <b>law</b> after being given  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent" cat="">Royal Assent</a>  by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="">Queen Elizabeth II</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator" cat="legislator	legislature	profession	occupation">Lawmakers</a>  in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="house">House of Commons</a>  overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier this year, but the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords" cat="house">House of Lords</a>  this month rejected it for the third time.   The Lords' powers, however, are limited to delaying  <b>legislation</b> by blocking it and bouncing it back to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="house">House of Commons</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Acts_1911_and_1949" cat="dispute	laws">The Parliament Act</a>  was created to ensure that the will of the country's elected lawmakers prevails.   The bill brings  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">Britain</a>  in line with most other  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_State_of_the_European_Union" cat="">European Union nations</a> .   ``It is a reform which, in my personal view, is long overdue and is only right for a country that has a history of reform and challenging  <b>prejudice</b>,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary" cat="establishment	office">Home Secretary</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Straw" cat="witness	person	secretary	anglican	politics	leaders	member	chancellor	president">Jack Straw</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" cat="country	member	nation	state	template">Britain</a> 's top  <b>law enforcement officer</b>.   ``This act will help us to build a safe, just and tolerant society,'' he added.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Mason" cat="activist	parent	person	commander	officer	servant">Angela Mason</a> ,  <b>director</b> of the  <b>gay rights</b> group  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_(UK)" cat="establishment	group">Stonewall</a> , said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="legislature	parliament	dispute	establishment">Parliament</a> 's action was ``a great step toward  <b>equality</b>.''   ``When the history books come to be written I believe it will be seen as the moment when this country finally began to change, when  <b>lesbians</b> and  <b>gay men</b> started to take our place as equal members of society,'' she said.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tatchell" cat="activist	citizen	republican	person	politician	immigrant">Peter Tatchell</a> , of the group  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OutRage!" cat="group	establishment	forum">OutRage</a> !, said: ``This victory is a welcome and historic milestone in the long struggle for  <b>gay</b>  <b>human rights</b>.''   ``My only regret is that it has taken 33 years during which time hundreds of  <b>gay men</b> have been unjustly jailed for  <b>victimless</b> relationships.''

Straw dismissed the criticism. ``In the circumstances I believe that the use of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Acts_1911_and_1949" cat="dispute	laws">the Parliament Act</a>  in this case is proper and justified,'' he said.   Five years ago,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" cat="legislature	parliament	dispute	establishment">Parliament</a>  narrowly rejected lowering the age of consent for  <b>homosexuals</b> to 16, reducing it instead from 21 to 18.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_behavior" cat="">Homosexual sex</a>  between adults  <b>ceased</b> to be a  <b>crime</b> in Britain three decades ago.  <br>
