A  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University" cat="university	institution">Florida State</a>   <b>judge</b> has ordered  <b>local election</b> officials to ship  <b>thousands</b> of ballots to the  <b>state capital</b>. The move comes as the  <b>judge</b> decides whether to order a recount of those ballots in the presidential election.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Public_Radio" cat="">NPR</a> 's Steve  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IÅ„sko_Landscape_Park" cat="">Inski</a>  was in the  <b>courtroom</b>. Steve, what are the issues that came up in this hearing tonight?   Corey  <b>judge</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N." cat="story	website">N.</a>  Sander Sauls is deciding whether to order a recount as you said of those ballots, 9000 or more actually from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida" cat="county">Miami Dade County</a>  that apparently were never counted at all, at least according to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrats</a>  in the  <b>presidential election</b> and about 3300 ballots from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida" cat="establishment	county">Palm Beach County</a>  that were considered by local officials but then thrown out, disallowed. Judge Sauls is deciding whether to count those ballots and go through them and perhaps add some votes to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Al Gore</a> 's final total, which is exactly what the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrats</a>  want. He is not ready to do that yet. He did not agree to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democratic</a>  proposal to begin counting  <b>tomorrow morning</b> but he has ordered that the ballots be shipped up. Later this week,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami,_Florida_Police_Department" cat="">Miami Police</a>  apparently are going to escort them upto  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida" cat="city	seats	place">Tallahassee</a>  and they will be ready to be counted if the  <b>judge</b> decides at a later time to do so.   Now time is a big consideration from here. What's the  <b>judge</b>'s timetable?   Not as fast as the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrats</a>  would like, not as slowly as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republicans</a>  would prefer. He is going to order a major hearing on Saturday to review all the legal and evidentiary issues, look at evidence, perhaps hear from witnesses and after that the  <b>judge</b> will  <b>decide</b> if there are any ballots to count. It might take another five days or so to do it. Neither side seemed  <b>particularly</b> pleased by the timetable but the  <b>judge</b> said, well, I am going to make everybody equally unhappy.   Thank you.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Public_Radio" cat="">NPR</a> 's Steven Inksi reporting from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida" cat="city	seats	place">Tallahassee, Florida</a> . As the battle over votes goes on in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a>  State is in the middle of recounting the votes cast in its very tight  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" cat="house">US Senate</a>  race. Jennifer Nesan reports from member station  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPLU-FM" cat="stations">KPLU</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington" cat="">Seattle</a> .   The recount of the votes cast for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Democrat</a>  Maria Catwell and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republican</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" cat="house">Senator</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" cat="magazine">Slate</a>  Gordon is calm and organized. The State's Elections Director Garry  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh" cat="computer	introduction	design">Macintosh</a>  says the process is about as exciting as watching  <b>paint</b> dry.   There are a lot of things about the election <b>'s process</b> I think that are fairly complex. This isn't probably one of them.   Catwell leads  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" cat="party	state">Republican</a>   <b>incumbent</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)" cat="magazine">Slate</a>  Gordon by fewer then  <b>2000</b> votes. At this point neither of the candidates plan to contest any of the votes. State  <b>law</b> requires a recount when the margin of victory is less than one half of 1 percent. The recount is expected to be completed by the end of the week. No  <b>statewide recount</b> in Washington has ever changed the initial outcome.
