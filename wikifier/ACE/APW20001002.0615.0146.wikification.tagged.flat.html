   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta" cat="capital	province	city	place	area	district">JAKARTA, Indonesia</a>  (AP) _ The youngest son of ex-dictator  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto" cat="person	general	muslim	leaders	politician	president">Suharto</a>  disobeyed a summons to surrender himself to prosecutors Monday and be imprisoned for  <b>corruption</b>.   Hutomo `` <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)" cat="film	character	opera	leaders">Tommy</a> '' Mandala Putra, 37, was sentenced to  <b>18 months</b> in  <b>prison</b> on Sept. 22 by the Supreme Court, which overturned an earlier  <b>acquittal</b> by a lower court.   It found him guilty of enriching himself through a property deal with the state's main food supply agency. Prosecutors said the  <b>1997</b> deal, made when his father was still in power, had cost the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language" cat="language">Indonesian</a>  state $10.8 million.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)" cat="film	character	opera	leaders">Tommy</a> , a  <b>multimillionaire</b> with a  <b>playboy</b> image and love of fast cars, is the first member of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto" cat="person	general	muslim	leaders	politician	president">Suharto</a> 's family to be convicted of  <b>graft</b>.   Because the Supreme Court's decision to imprison  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)" cat="film	character	opera	leaders">Tommy</a>  did not come into immediate effect, prosecutors served a summons on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)" cat="film	character	opera	leaders">Tommy</a>  to be taken into custody Monday. He instead sent a legal team to discuss whether he would appeal the ruling or admit his  <b>guilt</b> and seek a  <b>presidential pardon</b>.   The delay of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)" cat="film	character	opera	leaders">Tommy</a> 's arrest comes just days after another court dismissed other  <b>corruption</b> charges against his 79-year-old father on grounds of ill health, enraging pro-democracy activists and triggering violent demonstrations.   Critics of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" cat="state	nation	republic	country">Indonesia</a> 's  <b>legal system</b> have accused it of going soft on the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto" cat="person	general	muslim	leaders	politician	president">Suharto</a>   <b>clan</b>.   A co-defendant in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)" cat="film	character	opera	leaders">Tommy</a> 's case,  <b>businessman</b> Riccardo Gelael, separately admitted his  <b>guilt</b> Monday to prosecutors and said he would appeal to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" cat="president">President</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdurrahman_Wahid" cat="muslim	alumnus	politician	person	president	candidate	journalist">Abdurrahman Wahid</a>  for a  <b>pardon</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Antasari" cat="">Antasari</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashar" cat="">Ashar</a> , chief of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jakarta" cat="area">South Jakarta</a>  Prosecution Office, said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)" cat="film	character	opera	leaders">Tommy</a>  would again be summoned to meet prosecutors on Wednesday.   If  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_(film)" cat="film	character	opera	leaders">Tommy</a>  opts for a  <b>judicial review</b> of the case, his fate will be decided by the same court that last week dismissed  <b>graft</b> charges against his father.   The decision to let  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto" cat="person	general	muslim	leaders	politician	president">Suharto</a>  off triggered fierce street demonstrations, in which one man died and dozens were injured.   For weeks  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto" cat="person	general	muslim	leaders	politician	president">Suharto</a> 's trial had been marred by a series of bombings in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta" cat="capital	province	city	place	area	district">Jakarta</a> , including a blast at the city's  <b>stock exchange building</b> in which 15 people were killed.   Many suspect supporters of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto" cat="person	general	muslim	leaders	politician	president">Suharto</a> , who ruled for 32 years until his ouster in 1998, were behind the attacks.  <br>
