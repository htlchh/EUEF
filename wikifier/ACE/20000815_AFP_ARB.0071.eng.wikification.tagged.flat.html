   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut" cat="crusade	site	place	colony	mint	capital	city	location">Beirut</a>  8-15 (AFP) -   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanon</a>  has asked the international  <b>peacekeeping force</b> operating in the south to investigate reports indicating that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a>  is penetrating the shared border between the two countries and to prevent this from happening.   According to official sources, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanese</a>  authorities contacted the  <b>peacekeeping</b> high command and asked it to put an end to infringements by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a> , which is carrying out operations inside  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanese territory</a> , in particular dumping  <b>sand</b> and building slopes.   The source added that if this is confirmed, then such acts constitute a provocation and an infringement of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanese</a>   <b>sovereignty</b>.   Witnesses said two  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis" cat="person">Israeli</a>   <b>bulldozers</b> started work today Tuesday on a slope in the Abbad sector inside  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanese territory</a>  on the border between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanon</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israel</a> .   These witnesses told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse" cat="agency	company	establishment">Agence France Presse</a>  that an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" cat="dispute	recipient	relations	unit">Israeli army</a>  patrol equipped with ultra-modern  <b>binoculars</b> penetrated a few meters into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanese territory</a>  but withdrew back to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis" cat="person">Israeli</a>  territory as soon as a  <b>peacekeeping</b> patrol arrived.   Families in southern  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanon</a>  visit this area where, according to tradition, the burial site of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh" cat="title	role	words">Sheikh</a>  Abbad, who died 500 years ago, is located.  For their part,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israelis</a>  also regard the site as a  <b>shrine</b> because, according to them,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rav_Ashi" cat="person">Rabbi Ashi</a>  lived there in the  <b>5th century</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces_checkpoint" cat="">The Israeli army</a>  had previously carried out operations inside  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" cat="country	state">Lebanese territory</a>  in the same border  <b>region</b> on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_11" cat="days">August 11</a> .   Last Friday, an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" cat="dispute	recipient	relations	unit">Israeli</a>   <b>bulldozer</b> crossed the  <b>wire</b>  <b>fence</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi" cat="words	landforms	body">Wadi</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjayoun" cat="place">Marjayoun</a>  near the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" cat="republic	country	state	words">Israeli</a>   <b>village</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matla" cat="">Matla</a>  and spread  <b>sand</b> over a length of hundreds of meters and a width of six meters in order to expose the footprints of people crossing the border or  <b>tire</b> prints of cars from the Lebanese side. <br>
