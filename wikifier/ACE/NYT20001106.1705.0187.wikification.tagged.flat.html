The course that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a>  charted over his final hours on the campaign trail, plotted with as much concern for  <b>symbolism</b> as for raw electoral  <b>arithmetic</b>, left no doubt about where he placed the blame for that  <b>atmosphere</b>. His first major rally was in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee" cat="state">Tennessee</a>  and his last was planned for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas" cat="state">Arkansas</a> , the home states, respectively, of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Vice President Al Gore</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton" cat="humanitarian	recipient	saxophonist	spouse	nominee	candidate	memoirists	lawyer	winner	person	democrat	scholar	official	baptists	president	adoptee	activist	alumnus	companion	figure	politician	vegan">President Clinton</a> .   The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Texas" cat="list">Texas governor</a> 's words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country's best hope for bridging  <b>ideological</b> divides, healing  <b>partisan</b> wounds and making sure that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">Americans</a>  could gaze upon the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" cat="palace	landmark	building	residence	house	museum	structure">White House</a>  with unfettered respect.   ``There's a better day ahead if we have a leader who's willing to unite the country, to bring people together, to elevate the people's business above everyday  <b>politics</b>,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a>  said at a rally inside a  <b>hangar</b> at the  <b>airport</b> here, where supporters' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision.   ``One more day!'' they roared. ``One more day!''   What the nation needed,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a>  told them, was ``a president who can unite this nation, a president who puts aside the endless  <b>partisan</b> bickering that seems to  <b>gridlock</b> our nation's capitol, a president who puts the people first, a president who lifts this nation's spirits.   ``I'll be that president,'' he added, a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction. It underscored the  <b>optimism</b> that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a>  has, from the very beginning, sought to project to voters.   His schedule over the course of a 16-hour day was also an expression of that confidence.   In between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee" cat="state">Tennessee</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas" cat="state">Arkansas</a> , his campaign plane touched down in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin" cat="state">Wisconsin</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa" cat="state">Iowa</a> , and while any one of those four states could  <b>wind</b> up providing the key to a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a>  victory, none have as many  <b>electoral votes</b> as such battlegrounds as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" cat="colony	state">Pennsylvania</a> .   But they are genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be much more hospitable to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> .

He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him from the important business of  <b>beseeching</b> supporters to grant him victory.

Minutes later, he added: ``When you go out there and tell the  <b>folks</b> where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done, and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans" cat="">the American people</a> , I believe it doesn't matter what political party they're in.
