  WASHINGTON (AP) _  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" cat="">Fossil</a>  remains of a 120 million-year-old  <b>bird</b> with unique feathers cast doubt on the theory of  <b>birds</b> evolving from dinosaurs, some experts say, but others disagree.   Two Chinese researchers report that a  <b>fossil</b> called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a>  _ from a group of flying animals called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiornithes" cat="extinction	bird">Enantiornithine</a>  _ includes feathers that are ``different from those of all other known  <b>fossil</b> and modern feathers.''   Fucheng Zhang and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhonghe_City" cat="">Zhonghe</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty" cat="state	country">Zhou</a>  of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences" cat="academy	member">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>  suggest in the  <b>journal</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)" cat="journal">Science</a>  that the discovery supports the idea that feathers evolved from  <b>scales</b>, like those found in  <b>reptiles</b>. The study was to be published Friday.   Some researchers who oppose the idea that  <b>birds</b> evolved from dinosaurs embraced the new  <b>fossil</b> as proof that  <b>birds</b> and dinosaurs evolved independently from a common  <b>reptilian</b> ancestor.   But others say  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a>  adds nothing to the dino-bird debate.   ``There is nothing in the  <b>skeleton</b> of this  <b>bird</b> that disputes the  <b>dinosaur</b> origin of  <b>birds</b>,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_R._Holtz,_Jr." cat="paleontologist	person">Thomas R. Holtz Jr.</a> , a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park" cat="institution	university">University of Maryland</a>   <b>paleobiologist</b> and specialists on  <b>bird evolution</b>. ``The fact that this  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a>  has these weird flat feathers really doesn't affect that issue.''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Feduccia" cat="ornithologist	person">Alan Feduccia</a> , an  <b>evolutionary biologist</b> at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill" cat="structure	university	institution">University of North Carolina</a> , said the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine" cat="dispute	system">Chinese study</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a>  ``is a hot paper ... that directly contradicts the idea that  <b>birds</b> evolved from dinosaurs.''   The new fossil was unveiled the day after researchers announced that another ancient  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" cat="peoples	civilization	region">Chinese</a>   <b>bird</b>, called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microraptor" cat="dinosaur">Microraptor zhaoianus</a> , supported the  <b>dinosaur</b> origin of  <b>birds</b>.   In the study, Zhang and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty" cat="state	country">Zhou</a>  described the  <b>feather</b> and  <b>bone structure</b> found in a  <b>fossil</b> of a starling-sized  <b>bird</b> uncovered in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China" cat="region">northern China</a> , the site of many  <b>dinosaur</b>  <b>fossil</b> finds.   The Chinese researchers said the feathers have some of the characteristics of modern feathers, but the structure is more primitive than feathers found on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx" cat="animal	bird	fauna	loanword	dinosaur">Archaeopteryx</a> , the earliest known  <b>bird</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx" cat="animal	bird	fauna	loanword	dinosaur">Archaeopteryx</a>  appeared about 145 million years ago, while  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a>  was dated as more recent, about 120 million years ago.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microraptor" cat="dinosaur">Microraptor</a> , which was about the size of a  <b>crow</b>, lived about 125 million years ago.   Some elements of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a>   <b>wing</b>  <b>bone</b> and  <b>muscle</b> structure match those of  <b>modern birds</b>, said Zhang and Zhou, but the  <b>wing</b> retains a  <b>claw</b> found on some primitive birdlike animals. In  <b>modern birds</b>, that  <b>claw</b> has disappeared and been replaced with a structure that adds lift to the  <b>wing</b>. Nonetheless,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a>  is thought to have been a competent  <b>flier</b>.   Most  <b>dinosaur</b> researchers believe  <b>birds</b> evolved 150 to 180 million years ago from a  <b>dinosaur</b> group called  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropoda" cat="">Theropods</a> . Researchers cite fundamental  <b>skeleton</b> similarities to support the theory. The  <b>evolution</b> of feathers, however, has been less clear.   Some experts believe feathers evolved specifically to support flight, while others say feathers evolved first to provide  <b>warmth</b> or protection from  <b>water</b>.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil" cat="">Fossils</a>  of three  <b>theropods</b> bear hairlike images that some say could be the early precursors to feathers.   But Feduccia dismisses the  <b>theropod</b> hair as ``dino fuzz'' and cites the Zhang and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Dynasty" cat="state	country">Zhou</a>  paper as proof that feathers evolved from  <b>reptilian</b>  <b>scales</b> and that this could mean that  <b>birds</b> evolved independent of dinosaurs.   ``Bird feathers are very closely related to  <b>scales</b>,'' said Feduccia. ``It is clear they evolved from elongated  <b>scales</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_(The_Flintstones)" cat="character	dog	dinosaur">Dino</a>  fuzz has nothing to do with feathers.''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Martin" cat="person	paleontologist">Larry Martin</a> , a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kansas" cat="university	institution">University of Kansas</a>   <b>paleontologist</b>, said the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language" cat="language">Chinese</a>  researchers' paper ``is the strongest evidence yet that  <b>bird</b> feathers evolved for flight and that they were derived from  <b>scales</b>.''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_R._Holtz,_Jr." cat="paleontologist	person">Holtz</a> , however, notes that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a> , with its primitive feathers, lived millions of years after  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx" cat="animal	bird	fauna	loanword	dinosaur">Archaeopteryx</a> , which had feathers almost identical to those of  <b>modern birds</b>.   ``This means the feathers on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protopteryx" cat="bird">Protopteryx</a>  were probably an evolutionary reversal,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_R._Holtz,_Jr." cat="paleontologist	person">Holtz</a> , adding that there are many examples where such reversals occur in nature.   ``This just shows that feathers are extremely adaptable structures,'' he said.   Michael Novacek, a  <b>dinosaur</b> expert at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History" cat="museum	building">American Museum of Natural History</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> , says that the Zhang and Zhou study is ``ambiguous'' on the issue of  <b>dinosaurs and birds</b>.   ``The fact that you see a resemblance between scales and feathers doesn't eliminate dinosaurs as close relatives to  <b>birds</b>,'' said Novacek. He, too, said that  <b>evolution</b> reversals are not rare. He said, for example, that  <b>whale</b> ancestors lived on land and had  <b>fur</b>, but  <b>evolution</b> carried the huge  <b>mammals</b> back to the sea.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_R._Holtz,_Jr." cat="paleontologist	person">Holtz</a>  said the Zhang and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Zhou_of_Shang" cat="king	person">Zhou</a>  study is important because it adds new understanding about the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiornithes" cat="extinction	bird">Enantiornithine</a> , a  <b>bird</b> group that dominated the latter part of the age of dinosaurs.   ``The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiornithes" cat="extinction	bird">Enantiornithine</a>  got clobbered in the extinction event'' that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago, he said.   This was followed by the dominance of another  <b>bird</b> group, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithurae" cat="">Ornithurae</a> , which later evolved into  <b>modern birds</b>, said Holtz.   ___   On the Net:   Science journal: http://www.eurekalert.org   Dinosaurs: http://www.micro.utexas.edu/courses/mcmurry/spring98/21/justin.html  <br>
