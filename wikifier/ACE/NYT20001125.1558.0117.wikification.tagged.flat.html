Two men have been killed, and a third has been injured since the  <b>hunting</b> season opened on Nov. 15. All three accidents involved  <b>shotguns</b>, elevated platforms and a practice relatively new to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>  hunters _ shooting at  <b>deer</b> from trees. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>  season, one of the busiest, continues through  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_30" cat="days">Nov. 30</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm" cat="firearm">Firearm</a>  hunting from elevated platforms has long been legal in other states with heavy  <b>hunting</b>, like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" cat="colony	state">Pennsylvania</a> . But the practice is only in its  <b>third season</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a> , and officials say it appears that hunters still have a lot to learn about  <b>safety</b>. Lt. Suzanne Koppelo,  <b>hunter safety</b>  <b>administrator</b> of the  <b>law</b> enforcement division of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Department_of_Natural_Resources" cat="agency">Michigan Department of Natural Resources</a>  &UR; , &LR; said that since  <b>firearm</b> platform  <b>hunting</b> began in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>  there had been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice. Three were fatal. Two hunters shot themselves on platforms and another was killed on the ground by a  <b>hunter</b> shooting from a platform. ``If hunters exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of 20-some  <b>feet</b>, it would be almost a nonissue,'' said Koppelo. ``But given  <b>human nature</b>, that's not the case.''   More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a>  woods this year, where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the  <b>state</b>'s 1.9 million  <b>deer</b>. The numbers reinforce the need to improve  <b>education</b> about platform  <b>hunting</b> with  <b>firearms</b>, Koppelo said.   The practice is more commonly associated with hunters using  <b>bows and arrows</b>. Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the woods, they wait quietly, typically at a height of 15 to 20  <b>feet</b>, and fire down at  <b>deer</b> that wander below.   Despite the  <b>hunter</b> killed from the platform, Sgt. Larry D. Sargent,  <b>hunter</b>  <b>education</b> field coordinator for the  <b>law</b> enforcement division, says the practice does offer one safety advantage: errant shots typically thump harmlessly to the ground, rather than whistling through the woods and striking other people.   The problems primarily arise when hunters get in and out of position.   ``It's kind of hard climbing a  <b>tree</b> with a gun,''  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Williams" cat="person	writer">Rob Williams</a>  said, as he and a  <b>hunting</b> partner, Art Bush, waited on a recent morning in a conventional  <b>earthbound</b>  <b>hunting</b> blind about 20 miles west of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit,_Michigan" cat="">Detroit</a> .   For  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WilliamsF1" cat="">Williams</a> , Rule No. 1 is not to climb a  <b>tree</b> with a  <b>loaded gun</b>. He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a  <b>rope</b> dangling from his belt to his gun, which he leaves unloaded on the ground. When he is secure in his stand, he pulls his gun up after him and loads it. Sargent says this is proper procedure.   One accident this year, however, illustrates the importance of following each step of the  <b>safety</b> procedures. A 16-year-old  <b>hunter</b> used a haul line, but it was tied to the  <b>trigger guard</b> and he left the gun loaded, Koppelo said. The  <b>teen-ager</b>'s gun went off and he was shot in the foot.   Others are hurt falling out of trees. Koppelo said that  <b>state</b> officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it was difficult, since they relied on hunters reporting minor accidents.   ``A lot of guys are embarrassed,'' Sargent said. ``They'll say they fell working in the yard or something.''   Others, Koppelo says, do not  <b>want to</b> report accidents for fear the  <b>law</b> will be changed. And she adds that though anecdotal reports show  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan" cat="state">Michigan</a> 's large  <b>hunting</b>  <b>population</b> to be taking slowly to  <b>firearm</b>  <b>deer hunting</b> from platforms, most expect the practice to catch on as it has in other states.   As Peter Thompson, a 16-year-old hunter, said, ``Usually the deer don't look up.''  <br>
