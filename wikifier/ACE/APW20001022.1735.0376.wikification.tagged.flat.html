   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" cat="variety">ROME, Italy</a>  (AP) _ A little  <b>mountain</b>  <b>village</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy" cat="">northern Italy</a>  buried five victims of last week's devastating high  <b>water</b> and mudslides on Sunday, the day a state of emergency finally ran out.   Floodwaters throughout the  <b>region</b>, including the raging  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_River" cat="">Po River</a> , have ebbed, emptying into the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea" cat="">Adriatic</a>  and revealing a rising toll of damage. Some roads and bridges are still closed and could remain so for some time, officials say.   The death toll from the raging floodwaters and fearsome  <b>mudslides</b> reached 37 combined for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps" cat="province	mountain">Alpine region</a>  of northern  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" cat="country	nation	member	state	monarchy">Italy</a>  and southern  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" cat="country	state">Switzerland</a> . Eighteen of those were from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aosta_Valley" cat="province	region">Valle d'Aosta</a>  in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps" cat="province	mountain">Italian Alps</a> .   At the church of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conzano" cat="city">San Maurizio</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FÃ©nis" cat="">Fenis</a> , a  <b>mountain</b>  <b>hamlet</b> near the city of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aosta" cat="city">Aosta</a> , villagers paid their final respects to five local victims. Among them, double losses for two families _ a father and son in one, a mother and daughter in another.   Amid the  <b>grief</b> in communities throughout the stricken area, life was slowly returning to something resembling normal. But thousands were still unable to go back to their drenched or damaged homes and a huge task of rebuilding lay ahead. Authorities estimate the damage in the hundreds of million of dollars.  <br>
