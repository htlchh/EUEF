Times News Service</a>  &QC; &LR; &QL;    Swarms of  <b>jellyfish</b> consumed so many  <b>fish eggs</b> and  <b>larvae</b> in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" cat="landforms">Gulf of Mexico</a>  this summer that some scientists are talking about the potential for serious future threats to commercial and  <b>recreational fisheries</b> in the northern Gulf.   The  <b>jellyfish</b>, a  <b>native species</b> and an invading one, appeared in prime  <b>spawning</b> areas just as breeding season for many of the Gulf's most important  <b>species</b> kicked into high gear.   According to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Marine_Fisheries_Service" cat="organization">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> , the number of  <b>jellyfish</b> in the Gulf has been rising for at least  <b>13 years</b>. Scientists say the  <b>jellyfish</b> are exploiting three major  <b>human-induced changes</b> in the environment: thousands of  <b>oil rigs</b> and  <b>artificial reefs</b> established to attract  <b>game fish</b> have greatly increased the breeding  <b>habitat</b> for  <b>jellyfish</b>, which need a  <b>hard surface</b> for spawning;  <b>nitrogen pollution</b> from  <b>farm</b>  <b>runoff</b> and  <b>industrial sources</b> feeds  <b>plankton</b> blooms, providing extra food for jellyfish; and commercial fishermen take  <b>great numbers</b> of  <b>menhaden</b>, a soft-finned,  <b>bony fish</b> that competes with  <b>jellyfish</b> for the  <b>plankton</b>.   Dr. Monty Graham, a researcher at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dauphin_Island_Sea_Lab" cat="museum">Dauphin Island Sea Lab</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" cat="state	colony">Alabama</a> , worries that with all these advantages  <b>jellyfish</b> cannot help but multiply at an astonishing rate.   Making matters much worse, he said, is the advent of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllorhiza_punctata" cat="">Phyllorhiza punctata</a> , or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" cat="country	state	member	nation	colony">Australian</a>  spotted jellyfish. The giant  <b>species</b>, previously unreported in the Gulf, is a 25-pound bruiser of a  <b>jellyfish</b> native to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" cat="">Pacific</a> .   Some time ago the basketball-size  <b>jellyfish</b> established themselves in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean" cat="region	island">Caribbean</a> . This summer, after apparently riding  <b>ocean currents</b> north, they concentrated themselves in the passes between the  <b>barrier islands</b> that separate the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Sound" cat="">Mississippi Sound</a>  from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico" cat="landforms">Gulf of Mexico</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian" cat="newspaper	subsidiary">The Australian</a>   <b>jellyfish</b> have now mostly died off in the Gulf. But  <b>fishery</b> scientists worry that they may already have affected next year's  <b>fish</b> populations. And scientists say the animals were  <b>spawning</b> prodigiously, broadcasting millions of their own  <b>eggs</b> as they ate the  <b>eggs</b> and  <b>larvae</b> of  <b>native species</b>.   Popular  <b>sport fish</b>, including  <b>redfish</b>,  <b>speckled trout</b>, white  <b>trout</b> and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Spanish_mackerel" cat="">Spanish mackerel</a> , as well as commercially important  <b>species</b> like  <b>crabs</b> and  <b>menhaden</b>, spawn just outside the  <b>barrier islands</b>. This year, their  <b>eggs</b> and  <b>larvae</b> had to drift with  <b>tidal currents</b> through the jellyfish-choked passes to reach the  <b>estuaries</b> that serve as  <b>nurseries</b> for the baby  <b>fish</b>.   ``These things are incredibly efficient at turning the  <b>water</b> over, cleaning it of everything in it,'' Graham said. ``We're finding them with 200  <b>fish eggs</b> in their guts.''   The newcomers had a frighteningly effective feeding pattern that involved  <b>swimming</b> to the surface, then diving down to the bottom, scouring the  <b>water</b> of virtually every living thing smaller than a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB_gun" cat="weapon	gun	rifle">BB pellet</a> . After flowing through the  <b>jellyfish</b>  <b>gantlet</b>, scientists said, the  <b>water</b> was almost devoid of living things.   ``You really have two problems in terms of commercially important  <b>fish</b>,'' said Harriet M. Perry, director of the  <b>fisheries</b> section of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States" cat="">Gulf Coast</a>  Research Laboratory in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi" cat="state	colony">Mississippi</a> . ``First the  <b>jellies</b> are ingesting the  <b>larvae</b> and  <b>eggs</b> of these commercially important  <b>species</b>, and then the  <b>fish larvae</b> must compete with these incredibly efficient  <b>jellies</b> for the same food source.''   Perry said she worried that the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastigiidae" cat="">Phyllorhiza</a>  might become permanent residents. Graham said he feared that their offspring might appear in larger numbers next spring.   He noted, though, that the newcomers represented a small threat compared with the monstrous herds of native  <b>moon jellyfish</b> still  <b>swarming</b> offshore below  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" cat="state	colony">Alabama</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi" cat="state	colony">Mississippi</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana" cat="colony	state">Louisiana</a>  in a huge swath roughly  <b>100 miles</b> long and 30 miles wide.   It is these  <b>jellyfish</b> that worry Dr. Joanne Lyczkowski-Shultz, a  <b>larval</b> specialist with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Marine_Fisheries_Service" cat="organization">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> .   Lyczkowski-Shultz said the long-term picture might be bleak if the jellyfish populations continued to grow at their current pace. ``It could be totally devastating,'' she said.  <br>
