  WASHINGTON (AP) _ All else being equal, Duane  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roelands,_Western_Australia" cat="place">Roelands</a>  would prefer to dash off short instant  <b>text messages</b> to co-workers and friends with the service offered by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" cat="company	vendor">Microsoft</a>  _ the one he finds easiest to use.   But for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roelands,_Western_Australia" cat="place">Roelands</a> , all else is not equal: His office, clients and  <b>nearly</b> everyone else he knows use  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">America Online</a> 's messaging system. Now, he does too.   ``There are features that I want and I like,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roelands,_Western_Australia" cat="place">Roelands</a> , a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer" cat="occupation">Web developer</a> , who likens it to the battle between  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS" cat="format	introduction">VHS</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax" cat="product	format	metaphor	introduction">Beta</a>   <b>video recorders</b> in the 1980s. ``But the reality is if I use the better product, I get less functionality.''   For this reason,  <b>instant messaging</b> rivals like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" cat="company	vendor">Microsoft</a> , AT&AMP;T and ExciteAtHome maintain their users ought to be able to send messages to anyone else, regardless of what service they happen to have. That's not currently possible.   The companies are  <b>lobbying</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission" cat="agency	organization	authorities">the Federal Communications Commission</a>  to require  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  to make its product compatible with those offered by competitors as a condition of its merger with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> .   So far, the agency appears to favor a more  <b>tailored</b> approach. The commission's staff has recommended that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  be required to make its system work with at least one other provider, but the requirement would apply only to advanced  <b>instant messaging</b> services offered over  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's  <b>cable</b> lines.   How the agency defines advanced services is unclear. They could refer to features beyond  <b>text messaging</b>, such as  <b>video teleconferencing</b>, the sharing of files or messaging over  <b>interactive television</b>.   Today, consumers more commonly take advantage of the  <b>garden variety</b> functions. They type short  <b>real-time</b> phrases to others, allowing them to ``chat'' back-and-forth using text. Unlike  <b>e-mail</b>, it's instantaneous and gets the recipient's attention right away.   People can communicate with international friends without the  <b>hefty</b> phone bills. And the service has taken hold with those who have hearing or speech  <b>disabilities</b>.   Unlike the  <b>telephone</b>, people can discreetly interact with others _ or decide not to.   ``It's communications that can be  <b>ignored</b>,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Sacks" cat="academic	person	winner	jew	theologian	peer	holder">Jonathan Sacks</a> , a  <b>vice president</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a> , which runs the two leading messaging services _  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ" cat="client">ICQ</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Instant_Messenger" cat="client	introduction">AIM</a>  _ with 140 million users. ``On the  <b>telephone</b>, you can't see when somebody is near the phone. You can't see when it's convenient for them to communicate with you.''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  rivals say that if  <b>instant messaging</b> is to be as ubiquitous as the phone network, it has to work the same way: People who use different providers must still be able to contact one another. They continue to lobby the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission" cat="agency	organization	authorities">FCC</a> , hoping to see the conditions broadened before the agency issues its final decision.   ``It's really important to get this right before innovation is squashed because one company has a  <b>monopoly</b>,'' said Jon Englund,  <b>vice president</b> of government affairs for ExciteAtHome. ``It's absolutely critical that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" cat="medium	invention	introduction">Internet</a>  uses have real choice among competing platforms.''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  has said it wants to work toward  <b>interoperability</b>, but first needs to protect  <b>consumer privacy</b> and security to prevent the kinds of problems that have emerged in the  <b>e-mail</b> world, like spamming _  <b>unwanted</b>  <b>junk</b> messages.   Company officials disagreed that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a> 's  <b>market share</b> was keeping out competitors.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  executives cited a recent study by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ComScore" cat="company">Media Metrix</a>  indicating that the messaging services offered by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!" cat="company	provider	property	engine">Yahoo</a> ! and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" cat="company	vendor">Microsoft</a>  are the fastest growing in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">United States</a> .   Why all the fuss over a  <b>free product</b> that anyone, even those who don't subscribe to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a> , can use?   Some pointed to the recent demise of two instant messaging competitors _  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICast" cat="">iCAST</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_Voice" cat="album">Tribal Voice</a>  _ as evidence that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a> 's dominance could prevent choices in the market.   Another concern is that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  could use its substantial customer base to  <b>tack</b> on new advanced services and then charge for them.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivals.com" cat="">Rivals</a>  said the ability of various services to work together will become  <b>increasingly</b> important in the future. For example, as instant messaging  <b>migrates</b> to  <b>cell phones</b> or  <b>hand-held computer</b> organizers, consumers won't  <b>want to</b> have to install multiple services on these devices, said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Park" cat="">Brian Park</a> , senior product for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!" cat="company	provider	property	engine">Yahoo</a> ! Communications Services.   ``You can have the best service and the coolest features, but nobody is going to use it if it doesn't communicate with other services,'' Park said.   ___   On the Net:   America Online corporate site: http://corp.aol.com   IMUnified, coalition formed by AT&AMP;T, ExciteAtHome, Microsoft: http://www.imunified.org/  <br>
