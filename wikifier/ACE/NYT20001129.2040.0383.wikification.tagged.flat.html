But lawyers for Gov.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">George W.

To that end, they persuaded  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_judge_(UK)" cat="">Circuit Judge</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N." cat="story	website">N.</a>  Sanders Sauls to order 1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida" cat="county">Miami-Dade</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida" cat="establishment	county">Palm Beach</a>   <b>counties</b> _ brought up from south  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" cat="colony	state">Florida</a>  and placed in the court's custody.

And it could take weeks if not months to count them all, the point that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry,_Vale_of_Glamorgan" cat="port	place	resort">Barry</a>  Richard,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a> 's chief  <b>trial lawyer</b> here, said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be transported here.   ``We did it to make a point,'' Richard said in an interview. ``If you recount any ballots, you have to recount all of them. Now, we don't think any ballots should be counted, because the manual recount of ballots is finished. But in the event the court determines that some ballots should be counted, we wanted them here so they could all be counted.''   Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's lawyers barely objected to the move, asking only that the disputed ballots that might contain hidden  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a>  votes be separated from the  <b>mass</b>.   ``I know when it's futile,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Boies" cat="person	lawyer	democrat	alumnus	executive">David Boies</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's chief  <b>trial lawyer</b>, to Sauls.   Nonetheless,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's lawyers were furious at the move, aware that it represents yet another  <b>enormous</b> barrier to their  <b>hopes</b> for an immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties and a quick decision from the  <b>judge</b> that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a>  really won the election. Even if the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Supreme_Court" cat="">Florida Supreme Court</a>  should swiftly agree to their request and orders the counting to begin by Friday, that would still put them three days behind their original timetable. And facing a Dec. 12 deadline for the  <b>state</b> to name electors for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)" cat="state	establishment">Electoral College</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a>  has absolutely no days to spare.   ``It's a  <b>stunt</b>,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall,_Florida" cat="community	place">Kendall</a>  Coffey, one of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's election lawyers, as he stormed out of Sauls' courtroom Wednesday, referring to the request for all the ballots. ``They're trying to  <b>bog</b> down the case, the system, the clerk's office and everywhere else they can.''   The decision by Gore's lawyers to appeal the case shows how  <b>perilous</b> their situation is. By appealing, the lawyers were forced to put on paper their fear that their case could be over if they cannot begin counting ballots until Saturday.   The decision to wait until a Saturday hearing ``is effectively a final order denying all relief sought by plaintiffs because the action now pending below must be completed before Dec. 12, 2000, in order to offer any relief,'' said the notice filed with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court" cat="court">Court of Appeal</a> . It adds, ``the court must  <b>allow</b> sufficient time to complete an accurate and fair count of the contested ballots, which is essential for the proper resolution of the contest action.''   But the decision to bring up all the ballots means that they will not be assembled in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida" cat="city	seats	place">Tallahassee</a>  until  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Videos" cat="ending	show">late Friday</a> , a day later than planned. And even then, the  <b>hurdles</b> are enormous. There will have to be another hearing before the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Supreme_Court" cat="">Florida Supreme Court</a> , and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore" cat="candidate	president	blogger	nominee	person	soldier	writer	environmentalist	winner	alumnus	democrat	senator	member	correspondent	capitalist	director	personnel	baptists">Gore</a> 's lawyers will have to  <b>refute</b> three arguments to be raised by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">Bush</a>  team: There should be no more counting at all; if there is any counting, it will have to include all 1.16 million ballots; and if there is any counting of disputed ballots,  <b>dimples</b> cannot be counted as votes.   If these issues are heard before Sanders, there will have to be  <b>briefs</b>, witnesses, and evidence on each point, which could take days. If the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" cat="court	establishment">Supreme Court</a>  agrees to  <b>short-circuit</b> the process, there will still have to be lengthy  <b>briefs</b> filed, and the court may need to wait several days before finding time for yet another momentous hearing in its schedule.  <br>
