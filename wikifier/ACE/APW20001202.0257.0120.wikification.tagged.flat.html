Koetter, 41, replaces  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Snyder" cat="coach	person	player">Bruce Snyder</a> , who was fired after nine seasons.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snyder,_Oklahoma" cat="city">Snyder</a>  will  <b>coach</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football" cat="club	team">Arizona State</a>  in a  <b>bowl game</b>, most likely the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Bowl" cat="">Las Vegas Bowl</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oklahoman" cat="newspaper">The Daily Oklahoman</a>  and several TV and  <b>radio stations</b> in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma" cat="state">Oklahoma</a>  had reported Thursday and Friday that Koetter had accepted the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma" cat="state">Oklahoma</a>  State job.   But Phillips never confirmed those reports, and Koetter would not comment on any job possibilities at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_State_University" cat="university	institution">Boise State</a> 's practice Friday. Koetter said earlier in the week he had interviewed with Phillips and with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University" cat="university	institution	building">Arizona State</a>   <b>athletic director</b> Gene Smith.   Koetter is considered one of the country's top young coaching prospects. Using an innovative, wide-open offense, he guided  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_State_University" cat="university	institution">Boise State</a>  to a 25-10 record in three seasons. His first team went 6-5, followed by last year's 10-3 record, which included a 34-31 victory over  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Louisville" cat="university	institution	school	establishment">Louisville</a>  in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_Bowl" cat="sport">Humanitarian Bowl</a> .   This year's team is 9-2, with its only losses 38-31 at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas" cat="state">Arkansas</a>  and 42-25 at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars" cat="team">Washington State</a> .   Koetter may not have been  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University" cat="university	institution	building">Arizona State</a> 's top choice.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Radio" cat="stations">Phoenix radio</a>  station  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMVP" cat="stations">KMVP</a>  reported Friday that Smith had  <b>quietly</b> been working on a deal with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Christian_University" cat="institution	university	school">TCU</a>   <b>coach</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Franchione" cat="coach	person	alumnus">Dennis Franchione</a>  that would have matched the one offered by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" cat="state	colony">Alabama</a> . But Franchione apparently couldn't resist the lure of one of  <b>college football</b>'s most  <b>storied</b> programs.   While most of the recent speculation centered on Koetter, there was pressure from some  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University" cat="university	institution	building">Arizona State</a>  boosters to hire  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_White" cat="coach	person	announcer	player	quarterback	punter">Danny White</a> , the former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils" cat="team">Arizona State</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys" cat="team	cowboy	sport	club">Dallas Cowboys</a>   <b>quarterback</b> who coaches the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Rattlers" cat="sport	team	club">Arizona Rattlers</a>  of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_Football_League" cat="league	company">Arena Football League</a> .   Snyder was fired after his teams went 6-6 last year and 6-5 this season.  <br>
