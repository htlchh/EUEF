(AP) _ Joseph Conrad Parkhurst, who founded the  <b>motorcycle</b>  <b>magazine</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_World" cat="magazine">Cycle World</a>  in  <b>1962</b>, has died. He was 74.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkhurst_(HM_Prison)" cat="prison">Parkhurst</a>  had  <b>lung cancer</b> and died Tuesday as a result of a  <b>blood clot</b> in his  <b>lung</b>, his wife Claire Parkhurst told the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" cat="newspaper	subsidiary	recipient">Los Angeles Times</a>  for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_editions" cat="">Sunday editions</a> .    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_World" cat="magazine">Cycle World</a>  brought  <b>objective journalism</b> to  <b>motorcycle</b>  <b>periodicals</b> by offering road tests and a more critical  <b>eye</b> than other fan-oriented magazines, said analyst  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Brown" cat="">Don Brown</a>  of DJB Associates  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company" cat="">LLC</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California" cat="city	place">Irvine</a> .   In its first year,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_World" cat="magazine">Cycle World</a>  became _ and remains _ the largest  <b>motorcycle</b>  <b>magazine</b> in the world, Brown and others said. It boasts a monthly circulation of 315,000 and its closest rival is the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" cat="language">German</a>   <b>magazine</b> Das Motorrad.   ``Joe was a true pioneer in our business,'' said current  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_World" cat="magazine">Cycle World</a>   <b>publisher</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Little" cat="player	dolphin	coach	person	guard	charger">Larry Little</a> . ``It was kind of a breaking of a  <b>good old boy</b> network of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>   <b>motorcycles</b>. Joe did not shun the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language" cat="language">Japanese</a>  makers.''   Born in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonesboro,_Arkansas" cat="city	seats">Jonesboro</a> , Ark., on Oct. 20, 1926, Parkhurst moved with his family to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" cat="state	colony">California</a> . He served in 1954-56 as a clerk in an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_reserve_force" cat="force">Army Reserves</a>  office, then took a job as  <b>art director</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_&_Track" cat="magazine">Road & Track magazine</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California" cat="place	city	location">Newport Beach</a> .   He later quit to spend a year traveling in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" cat="concept">Europe</a>  and returned to become  <b>art director</b> of Carting World, a  <b>go-cart</b>  <b>magazine</b>, in  <b>1960</b>. While working, Parkhurst began dreaming of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_World" cat="magazine">Cycle World</a> .   He thought that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_&_Track" cat="magazine">Road & Track</a> 's consumer approach could serve motorcyclists, said Joe  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slimnic" cat="">Rusz</a> , a senior  <b>editor</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_&_Track" cat="magazine">Road & Track</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkhurst_(HM_Prison)" cat="prison">Parkhurst</a>  also loved  <b>riding</b>  <b>motorcycles</b> and once  <b>told</b> a friend that he ``could never find something worthwhile to read about them,'' Little said.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkhurst_(HM_Prison)" cat="prison">Parkhurst</a>  later merged with another company that owned  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_&_Track" cat="magazine">Road & Track</a>  to become Bond/Parkhurst Publishing. He sold both magazines in the early 1970s, said his wife of 22 years. Since  <b>1979</b>, he has written and published the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle" cat="motorcycle	introduction	vehicle">Motorcycle</a>  Business Newsletter, a biweekly for industry insiders.   In addition to his wife, Parkhurst is survived by a brother,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Parkhurst" cat="person	bishop">John Parkhurst</a>  of Hemet. A memorial is planned for January.  <br>
