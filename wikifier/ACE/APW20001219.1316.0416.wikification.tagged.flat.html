   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Center" cat="venue	arena	establishment	building	sponsorship">DENVER</a>  (AP) _  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos" cat="team	sport	bronco	club">The Denver Broncos</a>  and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League" cat="league	cooperative	supraorganizations">NFL</a>  want a  <b>commercial real estate</b> agent to take down a sign advertising a site for a potential  <b>sports bar</b> because it features the team's name.   John ``Jack'' Hanlon of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldwell_Banker" cat="company	franchise	brand	establishment">Coldwell Banker</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>  Spectrum is listing an  <b>acre</b> of land about a  <b>mile</b> from the Broncos' training camp in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dove_(brand)" cat="introduction	brand">Dove</a>  Valley.   Hanlon, a  <b>longtime</b> Broncos fan, thinks it is the perfect place for a  <b>sports bar</b> and has put up a blue-and-orange sign reading, ``Wanted Broncos Sports Bar On This Site.''   He said that 47,000 cars drive by the site daily and ``because the players have to drive by it every day it could become a hangout for them.''   Hanlon said he never has implied that the future  <b>sports bar</b> would be called the Broncos  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_association" cat="association	organization">Bar</a> , but his company has turned over the matter to its  <b>legal department</b>.   ``I thought it would be a  <b>good idea</b> to have a  <b>bar</b> that would celebrate  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Broncos" cat="">the Broncos</a> , emphasizing everything  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos" cat="team	sport	bronco	club">Broncos</a>  with  <b>pregame</b> and postgame activities,'' Hanlon said. ``But I couldn't put that on a 4-by-8 sign.''   He said he will do whatever his  <b>lawyer</b> advises, but ``I don't think  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Broncos" cat="">the Broncos</a>  own the word  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos" cat="team	sport	bronco	club">'Broncos</a> .'''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League" cat="league	cooperative	supraorganizations">NFL</a>  lawyer David Proper has given Hanlon until Dec. 26 to remove the sign.   In a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_28" cat="days">Nov. 28</a>  letter, Proper states ``while we have no objection to your  <b>advertising</b> the property as a location for a  <b>sports bar</b>, using the Broncos' name and colors gives the  <b>false impression</b> that the  <b>bar</b> is or can be affiliated with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Broncos" cat="">the Broncos</a> .''   The land is valued at $650,000 and the bar could cost about $1 million to $1.2 million, Hanlon said.  <br>
