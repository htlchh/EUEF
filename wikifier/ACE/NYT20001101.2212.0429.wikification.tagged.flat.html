 MERGER &QL; By ALEX BERENSON &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; c.2000  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_The_New_York_Times_Company" cat="list">N.Y. Times News Service</a>  &QC; &LR; &QL; &UR; &LR; Back in January, when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" cat="medium	invention	introduction">Internet</a>   <b>stocks</b> were hot,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">America Online</a>  agreed to buy  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>  with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  stock. The deal, if approved by regulators, would leave  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>   <b>shareholders</b> with 55 percent of the merged company, even though  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's revenue and  <b>cash flow</b> are far greater.    Since then,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a> 's stock has fallen by almost a third, destroying most of the premium the company had offered for control of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> . So a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>   <b>shareholder</b> might conclude that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">America Online</a> 's chairman,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Case" cat="person	alumnus">Stephen Case</a> , had  <b>bamboozled</b> his  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>  counterpart,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_M._Levin" cat="owner	alumnus	executive	person	jew	philanthropist">Gerald Levin</a> , into taking  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a> 's shares at the worst possible time.   ``Short term, anyone objective would say probably Steve got the better part of the deal,'' said Larry Haverty, a senior  <b>vice president</b> at State Street Research in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts" cat="">Boston</a>  and a  <b>longtime</b> media  <b>investor</b>.   But Haverty, like many other  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>   <b>shareholders</b> and industry analysts, hardly cares. With the merger likely to be completed later this month, he predicts that the merged company will grow quickly by combining  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a> 's  <b>marketing</b> skills and captive base of online users with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's huge  <b>library</b> of films, magazines and the like and its relationships with major  <b>advertisers</b>.   ``The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the world,'' Haverty said. ``Five years out, if you're a  <b>shareholder</b> in this company, you're going to be a happy camper.''   That view is widely shared. ``Strategically, it makes a lot of sense,'' said Tom Wolzien of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Bernstein" cat="">Sanford C. Bernstein</a> . ``These companies fill the holes of the other one. They're subscription-advertising combo models. The reality is the pieces are very compatible.''   To be sure, the recent history of big  <b>media mergers</b> is hardly  <b>comforting</b> for  <b>shareholders</b> in either  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  or  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" cat="company	subsidiary">Disney</a>  stumbled badly after it bought Capital Cities/ABC in  <b>1996</b>, and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>  stagnated for five years after it was created in  <b>1990</b> by the merger of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" cat="person	recipient	subsidiary	magazine">Time</a>  and Warner. ``Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of uncertainty,'' said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McNamee" cat="alumnus	person	member">Roger McNamee</a>  of Integral Capital, which sold its 404,000  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  shares the day the merger was announced.   But if the merged company can overcome that hurdle, it will have big advantages over  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" cat="company	subsidiary">Disney</a>  and other traditional media companies, which are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" cat="medium	invention	introduction">Internet</a> , said Jessica Reif of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch" cat="dealer	company	banks">Merrill Lynch</a> .   ``Given the multiple distribution platforms that they have, it's obviously a very powerful consumer  <b>engine</b>,'' Reif said. ``There's a reason that you see  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" cat="company	subsidiary">Disney</a>  and to a lesser extent  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" cat="network	company">NBC</a>  screaming in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a> .''    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schreiber" cat="writer	person">John Schreiber</a> , an assistant  <b>portfolio manager</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Capital_Group" cat="family	company">Janus</a>  Capital, the  <b>mutual fund</b> company that is  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's largest  <b>shareholder</b>, with more than 120 million shares, said the companies had already begun to demonstrate how they would work together. For example,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">AOL</a>  has pitched  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's magazines to its users, resulting in hundreds of  <b>thousands</b> of new subscriptions. And the companies are trying to sell big  <b>advertisers</b> on  <b>deals</b> that will reach both  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">America Online</a>  users and the people who watch  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner_Cable" cat="company	subsidiary">Time Warner cable</a>  channels and read its magazines,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreiber,_Ontario" cat="municipality">Schreiber</a>  said.   ``Once the merger closes, I think you'll see some very powerful cross-promotional  <b>deals</b> across all of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a> 's  <b>advertisers</b>,'' he said.    <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreiber,_Ontario" cat="municipality">Schreiber</a>  also says the risk of cultural clashes between the companies is limited, because the companies disclosed publicly where top executives would stand in the combined company only a few weeks after the merger was announced. So people who feel their responsibilities have been diminished have had months to look for new jobs, and some have already left, he said.   Given the strength he sees in the combined company,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreiber,_Ontario" cat="municipality">Schreiber</a>  said the question of whether Levin could have negotiated a better deal with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL" cat="provider	services	dispute	company	subsidiary">America Online</a>  is  <b>moot</b>. Shares in  <b>cable</b> companies like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast" cat="dispute	company	provider">Comcast</a>  have fallen 15 percent or more this year, while big media companies have been flat or up slightly. So ``it's not as if  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner" cat="company	owner">Time Warner</a>   <b>shareholders</b> have lost out on a great deal of upside,'' Schreiber said.  <br>
