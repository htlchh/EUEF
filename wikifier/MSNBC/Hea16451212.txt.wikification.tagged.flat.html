Many parents are forced to struggle with a  <b>patchwork</b> of other provisions in order to get  <b>health care</b> for their children. <br> <br>“The problem of the uninsured is getting worse,” and the number of uninsured children has risen since  <b>2004</b>, said Jennifer Tolbert, principal analyst with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser" cat="emperor	title	loanword">Kaiser</a>  Commission on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid" cat="">Medicaid</a>  and the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States" cat="">Uninsured</a> , a Washington-based think  <b>tank</b>. <br> <br>Tolbert said it was possible the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" cat="legislature	establishment">U.S. Congress</a>  could increase the scope of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program" cat="">SCHIP</a> ) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year. <br> <br>In the  <b>lurch</b> <br>Children with  <b>health insurance</b> are usually taken to the  <b>doctor</b> at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost. <br> <br>Then the child’s illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to  <b>nurse</b> the child back to health. <br> <br>In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" cat="state	colony">Alabama</a> , there were 230,000 uninsured children in  <b>1988</b>, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the Child Caring Foundation and state programs. <br> <br>Jody  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Corporation" cat="manufacturer	company">Sharp</a> , 60, is an example of the problem the  <b>charity</b> aims to address. <br> <br>She and her husband adopted a  <b>foster child</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Rosemary_Scallon" cat="entrant	woman	singer	politician	winner	person	musician	candidate	judges	member">Dana</a> , from a mother who was mentally  <b>handicapped</b>. Later, they adopted Dana’s brother  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Broflovski" cat="jew	character">Kyle</a>  who has  <b>epilepsy</b> and  <b>asthma</b>. <br> <br>But Sharp’s husband, the  <b>family wage</b> earner, walked out in  <b>1990</b>, leaving  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_Corporation" cat="manufacturer	company">Sharp</a>  to bring up the two children with no health insurance. <br> <br>“If you never had a child with  <b>epilepsy</b>, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no  <b>insurance</b>, it’s thousands of dollars just like that,” Sharp told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters" cat="services	agency	company	vendor">Reuters</a> . <br> <br>During their two years in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" cat="state	colony">Alabama</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Cross_and_Blue_Shield_Association" cat="">Blue Cross Blue Shield</a>  program, Sharp’s children received free medical care and she found a job working with  <b>special needs</b> children. The money saved helped her move into private  <b>health insurance</b>. <br> <br>Some 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private  <b>health insurance</b> within about 30 months. <br> <br>“All of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of  <b>insurance</b> so you don’t have to worry about squeezing  <b>doctor</b> bills out of an already stretched paycheck,” said Sharp. <br> <br>Bear's  <b>eye</b> <br>To recruit families,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Rohling" cat="person	theologian">Rohling</a>  tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama" cat="university	institution">University of Alabama</a>  at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama" cat="city	place	seats">Birmingham</a>  School of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing" cat="science	occupation">Nursing</a>  and elsewhere. <br> <br>At one recent presentation, a student  <b>nurse</b> pulled a  <b>teddy bear</b>  <b>eye</b> out of a child’s ear, ending three years of one-sided  <b>deafness</b>. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don’t have  <b>health insurance</b>. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_frills" cat="">Low cost</a>   <b>health insurance</b> for low income  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>  children began in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania" cat="">Pittsburgh</a>  in  <b>1985</b> when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highmark" cat="company">Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield</a>  of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania" cat="region">Western Pennsylvania</a>  insured children of  <b>laid-off</b>  <b>steel</b> workers. By  <b>2006</b>,  <b>144,000</b> children were in their program. <br> <br>“There was a crisis. And the whole thing came about as an answer for how  <b>health insurance</b> should work,” said spokesperson Denise Grabner of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highmark" cat="company">Highmark</a> . <br> <br>In  <b>1997</b>, the program expanded to include children of the  <b>working poor</b> when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" cat="legislature	establishment">Congress</a>  enacted the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program" cat="">SCHIP</a>  providing some matching funding. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" cat="state	colony">Alabama</a>  was the first of 20 states to participate, creating the All Kids program, with money from state settlement with  <b>tobacco companies</b>. The program provides  <b>insurance</b> for children above the level at which they would qualify for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid" cat="">Medicaid</a> . <br> <br>Many states now provide  <b>insurance</b> for families who earn up to double the  <b>poverty rate</b>, defined as $10,000 a year for a  <b>single person</b> and  <b>$20,000</b> for a family of four. But  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Rohling" cat="person	theologian">Rohling</a>  said an individual needed to earn  <b>nearly</b> three times the  <b>poverty level</b> to afford private insurance. <br> <br>“We fill the void between affordability and eligibility.” <br><br><br>
