Resolution to imbibe less goes awry  <b>—</b> already <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_(typeface)" cat="typeface">Myriad</a>  of conflicting medical studies are enough to drive this  <b>writer</b> to drink <br> <br>The fruitcake’s been digested, the  <b>gift cards</b> are empty, and now it’s time to face the most grueling holiday task of all: the annual reassessment. Do I  <b>need to</b> exercise more? Spend less? Set aside more  <b>quality time</b> for friends and family? The resolution list goes on and on  <b>—</b> much like that interminable  <b>karaoke</b> version of “Santa Baby” at this year’s holiday party. <br> <br>Unfortunately, since I was the one holding the  <b>microphone</b>, this year’s resolution seems painfully clear: Cut back on the  <b>alcohol</b> intake. <br> <br>Not that I drink a lot  <b>—</b> usually just a  <b>glass</b> of  <b>wine</b> with dinner, if that  <b>—</b> but I’ve read that even one drink a day can adversely affect my health. <br> <br>Also, a recent study by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" cat="organization	hospital">Mayo Clinic</a>  found that women’s bodies are less adept at breaking down  <b>alcohol</b> than men’s. As a result, the more we drink, the more we risk  <b>heart disease</b>,  <b>cancer</b>,  <b>cirrhosis</b> of the  <b>liver</b>, and, perhaps the most chilling  <b>side effect</b> of all  <b>—</b> kissing our  <b>skinny jeans</b> goodbye forever. <br> <br>But how much  <b>alcohol</b> is too much? There’s the rub. The answer seems to depend on which study you read.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic" cat="organization	hospital">The Mayo Clinic</a>  study says one drink a day is OK for “younger women who aren’t planning a pregnancy” and that “postmenopausal women should limit themselves to less.” But what about those of us who don’t fit in either category? <br> <br>Looking for a definitive answer, I turned to another study, this one conducted by a group of doctors at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University" cat="university	institution">Stony Brook University</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" cat="colony	state">New York</a> . But their  <b>finding</b> that drinking three  <b>glasses</b> of red wine a week reduces the risk of  <b>colorectal cancer</b> only confused matters further. <br> <br>Who to believe? <br>Should I cut back on  <b>alcohol</b> entirely in order to  <b>fend</b> off  <b>heart disease</b>,  <b>liver</b> problems and dreaded  <b>weight gain</b> (not to mention potential  <b>blackmail</b> opportunities by family, friends and co-workers) or suck down three or more glasses a week to keep the  <b>colorectal cancer</b> at  <b>bay</b>?  <br> <br>Or should I listen to the doctors the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Gothenburg" cat="institution	university">Goteborg University</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden" cat="country	state">Sweden</a> , who found that  <b>mice</b> that had ingested low levels of  <b>alcohol</b> on a daily basis showed a significantly  <b>lower risk</b> of developing  <b>rheumatoid arthritis</b> than  <b>mice</b> that just drank  <b>water</b>. Obsessed, I started digging through  <b>medical journals</b> and  <b>online health</b> stories until the studies began to  <b>stack</b> up like  <b>swizzle sticks</b> at a company-hosted  <b>bar</b>. <br> <br>In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" cat="capital	port	city	place">London</a> , researchers found that people who drank alcohol have a  <b>lower risk</b> of developing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but the risk of  <b>cancer</b> of the mouth, esophagus and liver actually increases. <br> <br>At  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University" cat="university	institution">Ohio State University</a> , a study showed that drinking moderately (such as a couple of drinks a day) improved the memories of  <b>laboratory rats</b>, although a study at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri" cat="university	institution">University of Missouri</a>  declared that  <b>alcohol</b> hindered academic success. <br> <br>Live longer so you can die young <br>Adding it all up, it seems that by drinking  <b>alcohol</b> I can both reduce my chances of  <b>heart disease</b> and increase my risk for  <b>high blood pressure</b>, fend off  <b>dementia</b> while upping my chances for  <b>brain damage</b>, boost my memory at the same time that I become more stupid, avoid  <b>lymphoma</b> while veering towards  <b>breast</b> and  <b>liver cancer</b>, and in general, both live longer and die younger. <br> <br>In other words, alcohol is every bit the hazy hypocritical demon it’s always been (especially when there’s a  <b>microphone</b> involved). So this year, I’m taking another resolution route altogether. Instead of squelching my  <b>alcohol</b> intake, I’m going to cut out  <b>karaoke</b>  <b>—</b> and perhaps limit my medical studies to just one per day with dinner, if that. <br> <br><br><br>
