He became  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" cat="occupation	executive">CEO</a>  in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2000" cat="">December 2000</a>  after being passed over for the top job at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric" cat="company	establishment	contractor	brand	manufacturer">General Electric Co.</a> , where Nardelli had been a senior executive. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">Home Depot</a>  said Nardelli was being replaced by  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Blake" cat="alumnus	clerk	executive	person">Frank Blake</a> , its vice chairman, effective immediately. <br> <br>Blake’s appointment is permanent,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">Home Depot</a>  spokesman Jerry Shields said. What he will be paid was not  <b>immediately</b> disclosed, Shields said. The company declined to make  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake" cat="writer	poet	person	anarchist	artist	author	vegetarian	prophets	advocate	mystic	painter	printmaker">Blake</a>  available for comment, and a message left for Nardelli with his secretary was not  <b>immediately</b> returned. <br> <br>Before Wednesday’s news, Home Depot’s stock had been down more than 3 percent on a split-adjusted basis since Nardelli took over. <br> <br>Nardelli’s sudden departure was stunning in that he told  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" cat="cooperative	agency	establishment	medium	recipient">The Associated Press</a>  as recently as  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1" cat="days">Sept. 1</a>  that he had no intention of leaving, and a key  <b>director</b> also said that the board was pleased with Nardelli despite the uproar by some investors. <br> <br>Asked in that interview if he had thought of hanging up his orange apron and leaving  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">Home Depot</a> , Nardelli said unequivocally that he hadn’t. Asked what he thought he would be doing 10 years from now, Nardelli said, “Selling hammers.” <br> <br>For  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">The Home Depot</a> ? <br> <br>“Absolutely,” he said at the time. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">Home Depot</a>  said Nardelli’s decision to resign was by mutual agreement with the Atlanta-based company. <br> <br>“We are very grateful to Bob for his strong leadership of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">The Home Depot</a>  over the past six years. Under Bob’s tenure, the company made significant and necessary investments that greatly improved the company’s infrastructure and operations, expanded our markets to include  <b>wholesale</b> distribution and new geographies, and undertook key strategic initiatives to strengthen the company’s foundation for the future,” Home Depot’s board said in a statement. <br> <br>Nardelli was a nuts-and-bolts leader, a former  <b>college football</b> player and friend of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" cat="convert	owner	alumnus	aviator	candidate	executive	republican	president	industrialist	person	politician	player	methodists	officer	episcopalian	recipient	nominee	speaker">President Bush</a> . He  <b>helped</b> increase revenue and profits at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">Home Depot</a>  and increase the number of stores the company operates to more than 2,000. Home Depot’s earnings per share have increased by approximately 150 percent over the last five years. But the  <b>public discussion</b> about his pay and the company’s stock price had become a distraction. <br> <br>Industry experts and analysts said his departure and Blake’s ascent to the top job are a good thing for Home Depot. <br> <br>“This is not about strategy or vision,” said James  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senn_High_School" cat="school">Senn</a> ,  <b>director</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_College,_Cambridge" cat="">Robinson College</a> ’s Center for Global Business Leadership at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University" cat="university	institution">Georgia State University.</a>  “This is coming down to two things. Really the foundation of leadership is credibility. Bob has run into some problems there. The second is execution.” <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">The Home Depot</a>  board also announced that Carol Tome, its  <b>chief financial officer</b>, and Joe DeAngelo, its executive  <b>vice president</b> for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">Home Depot</a>  Supply, will be assuming additional responsibilities. <br> <br>Tome will be assuming responsibility for  <b>mergers and acquisitions</b>, credit services and additional strategic responsibilities. DeAngelo was appointed to the newly created position of  <b>chief operating officer</b>. <br> <br>Nardelli and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">Home Depot</a>  have agreed to terms of a  <b>separation agreement</b> that would provide for payment of the amounts he is entitled to receive under his pre-existing  <b>employment contract</b> entered into in  <b>2000</b>. Under this agreement, Nardelli will receive consideration currently valued at about $210 million. <br> <br>The package includes a cash  <b>severance payment</b> of $20 million, the  <b>acceleration</b> of unvested deferred stock awards currently valued at approximately $77 million and unvested options with an  <b>intrinsic value</b> of approximately $7 million. It also includes payments of earned bonuses and long-term incentive awards of approximately $9 million, account balances under the Company’s 401(k) plan and other benefit programs currently valued at approximately $2 million, previously earned and vested deferred shares with an approximate value of $44 million, the  <b>present value</b> of retirement benefits currently valued at approximately $32 million and $18 million for other entitlements under his contract. Those entitlements will be paid over a four-year period and will be forfeited if he does not honor his contractual obligations. <br> <br>Nardelli has also agreed not to compete with the company for one year, and not to solicit employees or customers of the company for four years. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot" cat="dispute	retailer	company	store	subsidiary">Home Depot</a>  did not say what Nardelli would be doing next. <br> <br>In conjunction with the management changes, the board also announced that it had waived the retirement age of 72 and has asked  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clendenin" cat="">John L. Clendenin</a> , Claudio  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X" cat="combination">X.</a>  Gonzales and Milledge A. Hart III to stand for re-election at the  <b>2007</b> annual  <b>shareholders meeting</b>. This action was taken to retain these directors’ experience. Home Depot said the action was temporary. <br><br><br>
