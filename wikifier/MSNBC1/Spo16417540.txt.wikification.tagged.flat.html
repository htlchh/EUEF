Huizenga announced the departure at a  <b>news conference</b> that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Saban" cat="jew	person	billionaire	immigrant	democrat	ranger	zionist	owner">Saban</a>  didn’t attend. <br> <br>“It is what it is,” Huizenga said, borrowing Saban’s pet phrase. “I’m not upset because it’s more involved than what you think.” <br> <br>Since late November,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  had issued frequent, angry public denials of interest in moving to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama" cat="city	seats	place	capital	town">Tuscaloosa</a> . Huizenga said the change of heart wasn’t driven by money, and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  never sought a raise or contract extension. <br> <br>Instead, Huizenga hinted that family issues for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  and his wife, Terry, were a factor. <br> <br>“I’ve been through this with Nick for quite some time now, and I feel the  <b>pain</b> and so forth and so on of Nick and Terry, and it’s not a very simple thing,” Huizenga said. “I think Nick’s great. I’ll be Nick’s biggest fan. I’ll be cheering for him to win that bowl game.” <br> <br>A preference for the  <b>college</b> game and the campus lifestyle may have swayed  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a> . He won a  <b>national championship</b> at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football" cat="team	club">LSU</a>  and is 15-17 with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Neil_(album)" cat="album">the Dolphins</a> . This was his first losing season in  <b>13 years</b> as a  <b>head coach</b>. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide" cat="club	team">The Crimson Tide</a>  first approached  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  shortly after firing  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shula" cat="coordinator	buccaneer	player	coach	person	sportspeople	quarterback">Mike Shula</a> . Huizenga has said he received repeated assurances from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  that he would return in  <b>2007</b>, and two weeks ago  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  said: “I’m not going to be the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama" cat="university	institution">Alabama</a>  coach.” <br> <br>But when the Dolphins’ 6-10 season ended Sunday, Alabama sweetened an offer that reportedly would make him the highest-paid  <b>coach</b> in  <b>college football</b>. He had three years remaining on his  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami,_Florida" cat="">Miami</a>  contract at $4.5 million a year. <br> <br>In the past, Huizenga has been persuasive when dealing with coaches. He talked  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Shula" cat="player	cornerback	person	coach	alumnus	sportspeople">Don Shula</a>  into retirement in  <b>1996</b>, talked  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach)" cat="person	linemen	coach	announcer	contestant	participant	manager	player">Jimmy Johnson</a>  out of retiring three years later  <b>—</b> Johnson lasted one more season  <b>—</b> and was able to lure  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  to the pros in 2004 after other  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League" cat="league	cooperative	supraorganizations">NFL teams</a>  had failed. <br> <br>But this time, Huizenga failed to change Saban’s mind. <br> <br>After  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  turned down the Tide in early December, Alabama offered the job to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Rodriguez" cat="coach	person	safety	sportspeople	player">Rich Rodriguez</a> , but he decided to stay at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_West_Virginia_Mountaineers_football_team" cat="season">West Virginia</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama" cat="state	colony">Alabama</a>  lost last week to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_University–Stillwater" cat="institution	university">Oklahoma State</a>  in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Bowl" cat="sport">Independence Bowl</a>  to finish 6-7. <br> <br>Possible candidates to replace  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  include  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears" cat="team	bear	club">Chicago Bears</a>   <b>defensive coordinator</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivera" cat="coach	coordinator	linebacker	sportspeople	person	player">Ron Rivera</a> , former  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers" cat="sport	company	packer	club	team">Green Bay</a>   <b>head coach</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Sherman" cat="coach	person	coordinator	manager">Mike Sherman</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers" cat="team	charger	club">San Diego Chargers</a>   <b>offensive coordinator</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Cameron" cat="person	coach	coordinator">Cam Cameron</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts" cat="club	team">Indianapolis</a>  assistant  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Caldwell_(American_football)" cat="coach	buccaneer	player	person">Jim Caldwell</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans" cat="oiler	team	titan	sport	club">Tennessee Titans</a>   <b>offensive coordinator</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Chow" cat="sportspeople	coach	player	linemen	alumnus	person	coordinator">Norm Chow</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers" cat="team	club">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>  assistants  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Grimm" cat="guard	coach	player	person	alumnus">Russ Grimm</a>  and Ken Whisenhut. <br> <br>Huizenga didn’t rule out hiring a  <b>college coach</b>, as he did when  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  came to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Neil_(album)" cat="album">the Dolphins</a>  from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football" cat="team	club">LSU</a>  two years ago. <br> <br>“There’s only one thing I  <b>want to</b> do, and it’s win,” Huizenga said. “I don’t care what it takes, what it costs, what’s involved, we’re going to make this a winning  <b>franchise</b>. It’s no fun owning a team if you’re not winning, I can tell you that. And we are absolutely, positively going to get back to being a winning team. And sooner rather than later.” <br> <br>Leading the search for a  <b>coach</b> will be  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bailey_(author)" cat="writer	psychologist	person">Joe Bailey</a> ,  <b>chief executive officer</b> of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins" cat="team	dolphin	club">Dolphins</a>  Enterprises, and Brian Wiedmeier, the Dolphins’ president and  <b>chief operating officer</b>. The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals" cat="team	cardinal	sport	club	bird">Arizona Cardinals</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons" cat="club	sport	team">Atlanta Falcons</a>  are also seeking a new  <b>coach</b>. <br> <br>The Dolphins’ next coach will be their fourth in nine seasons. <br> <br>“I wish you hadn’t brought that up,” Huizenga said with a wry smile. <br> <br>It has been a frustrating a stretch of instability for a  <b>franchise</b> that had the same  <b>coach</b>  <b>—</b> Shula  <b>—</b> for 26 years. Miami has failed to make the  <b>playoffs</b> the past five years, a team record. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Neil_(album)" cat="album">The Dolphins</a>  are coming off their third losing season since  <b>1969</b> and likely face a roster overhaul. With  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daunte_Culpepper" cat="person	player	quarterback	recipient	adoptee">Daunte Culpepper</a>  struggling to recover from  <b>reconstructive knee surgery</b> in  <b>2005</b>,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami,_Florida" cat="">Miami</a>  remains unsettled at  <b>quarterback</b>, a troublesome position since  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Marino" cat="player	owner	american	sportspeople	alumnus	announcer	quarterback	person">Dan Marino</a>  retired seven years ago. The team needs  <b>upgrades</b> in almost every other area for a feeble offense and aging defense. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saban_Entertainment" cat="company	subsidiary">Saban</a>  leaves behind the NFL’s largest staff of assistants and  <b>general manager</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Mueller" cat="executive	alumnus	administrator	manager	person">Randy Mueller</a> , who might be given more responsibility under a new coaching regime. <br> <br>The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins" cat="team	dolphin	club">Dolphins</a>  haven’t reached the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs,_1987–88" cat="">AFC championship game</a>  since Huizenga became majority owner in 1994. <br> <br>“All I  <b>want to</b> figure out is how the heck we’re going to win,” he said. “And that’s what everyone with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Neil_(album)" cat="album">the Dolphins</a>  wants, to win. So win, win, win. That’s all I can say. We’re going to go out there and kick some butt and make something happen, I guarantee you.” <br>NCAA <br><br><br>
