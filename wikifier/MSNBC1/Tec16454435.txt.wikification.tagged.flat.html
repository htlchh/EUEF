Upgrade makes aging  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_rover" cat="artifact">Mars rovers</a>  smarter <br>Engineers transmitted new  <b>software</b> to the rovers' onboard computers <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" cat="">LOS ANGELES</a>  - The twin  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover" cat="vehicle	list	winner	mission">Mars rovers</a>  are getting wiser with age. <br> <br>Engineers have transmitted new flight  <b>software</b> to the rovers' onboard computers  <b>—</b> just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The  <b>software</b> is aimed at boosting their  <b>intelligence</b> and  <b>independence</b> so that they can roll around the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Red Planet</a>  with less help from humans. <br> <br>"We're teaching an  <b>old dog</b> new tricks," said John  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas" cat="person	winner	artist	singer	burial">Callas</a> , the mission  <b>project manager</b> with the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory" cat="landmark	establishment	site	building">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> , the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" cat="agency">NASA</a>  agency in charge of the  <b>rovers</b>. <br> <br>Among the rovers' new skills is the ability to automatically recognize and transmit to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="planet">Earth</a>  photographs that they take of swirling  <b>dust devils</b> or floating clouds. They can also independently  <b>decide</b> whether it is safe to extend its robotic arm to  <b>sample</b> a piece of  <b>rock</b>. <br> <br>Before, scientists had to painstakingly  <b>dissect</b>  <b>thousands</b> of images just to find the frames they need and decide for the rovers whether to use their arms. The  <b>high-tech</b>  <b>upgrades</b> should help save time  <b>—</b> as much as a day because scientists on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="planet">Earth</a>  don't have to study a rock before sending commands to the  <b>robot</b> to pick it up. <br> <br>If successful, the changes could get incorporated into future  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars" cat="">Mars missions</a> . <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover" cat="vehicle	list	winner	mission">Spirit and Opportunity</a>  were also fitted with a new  <b>navigation</b> system that allows them to think several steps ahead when faced with an obstacle, allowing them to back out of a  <b>dead end</b> or even navigate a  <b>maze</b> on their own,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas" cat="person	winner	artist	singer	burial">Callas</a>  said. The  <b>geologic</b> robots have previously tackled one problem at a time. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_rover" cat="probe">Spirit</a>  landed three years ago Wednesday and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_rover" cat="probe">Opportunity</a>  on Jan. 24, 2004. Entering their fourth year of exploration, both  <b>golf</b> cart-sized vehicles have long outlasted their missions, originally planned for about three months. While scientists are impressed by the rovers' longevity, they admit the robots could die at any time. <br> <br>The rovers' biggest accomplishment is  <b>uncovering</b>  <b>geologic</b> evidence that  <b>water</b> once flowed on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Mars</a> .  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_rover" cat="probe">Spirit</a>  is currently studying rocks and  <b>soil samples</b> near a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Martian</a>   <b>ridge</b> while Opportunity is circling the rim of a massive crater for possible ways in. <br><br><br>
