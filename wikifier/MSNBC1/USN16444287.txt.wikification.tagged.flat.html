Instead, he wound up shivering in a holding  <b>cell</b> without ever being  <b>told</b> why he couldn’t enter the country, he said. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxanne_(song)" cat="song	singles">Roxanne</a>  Hercules, a spokeswoman for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection" cat="services	establishment	border	agency	guard">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> , confirmed Tuesday that Shehadeh was denied entry, but would not discuss specifics of his case. She said Shehadeh’s visa waiver could have been denied because “he could have a  <b>criminal record</b>, or it could be a  <b>terrorism</b> issue.” <br> <br>The detention follows a series of similar incidents involving  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim" cat="muslim">Muslim</a>  passengers, according to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American-Islamic_Relations" cat="dispute	group	organization">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> . <br> <br>In October, an  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulema" cat="">Islamic scholar</a>  from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" cat="nation	member	country	state">South Africa</a>  was denied entry at  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport" cat="airport	building	airfield">San Francisco International Airport</a> . A month later, six  <b>imams</b> were taken off a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways" cat="company	member	airway	airline">US Airways</a>  flight from  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis,_Minnesota" cat="">Minneapolis</a>  to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona" cat="place	location	city	seats">Phoenix</a>  after a passenger reported overhearing them criticize the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war" cat="war	casualty	list">U.S. war</a>  in Iraq. <br> <br>“Overall these cases send a message that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim" cat="muslim">Muslims</a>  are  <b>second-class citizens</b> who can be detained and kept from their families,” said Affad  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh" cat="title	role	words">Shaikh</a> , a  <b>civil rights</b> coordinator for CAIR. <br> <br>‘Nobody ever informed me why’ <br>Shehadeh touched down  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Afternoon" cat="album">Thursday afternoon</a>  on a direct  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condor_Airlines" cat="">Condor Airlines</a>  flight to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport" cat="airport	building">McCarran International Airport</a> , where his  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sittenfeld" cat="personality	jew	writer	person	alumnus	novelist	schoolteacher	author">American wife</a>  was waiting to pick him up. The couple had planned to visit family in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley" cat="">Las Vegas area</a> , before surprising their daughter for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Year" cat="group">the New Year</a>  and celebrating her  <b>wedding anniversary</b> in Central California. <br> <br>“I gave them my  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_passport" cat="passport">German passport</a> , and he looked to see which countries I visited. He found I had  <b>stamps</b> that looked like  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language" cat="language">Arabic</a>  and asked if they were fake,” Shehadeh said Tuesday in a  <b>phone interview</b> from his home in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzenau" cat="">Alzenau</a> , a small  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria" cat="state">Bavarian</a>  village. <br> <br>“Nobody ever informed me why I was being questioned,” he said. “All that was ever  <b>told</b> to me was this had to do with Washington.” <br> <br>After being interrogated by Border Protection and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" cat="agency	establishment">FBI</a>  agents for more than 12 hours at the  <b>airport</b>, Shehadeh said he was handcuffed and transported in the back of  <b>police car</b> to a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Las_Vegas,_Nevada" cat="city	place">North Las Vegas</a>   <b>jail</b>. Officials told family members they had denied Shehadeh’s visa waiver, which grants  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" cat="state	republic	country	member	nation">German</a>  citizens the right to enter the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  with no additional paperwork, said his wife Joanne Mulligan. <br> <br>Officials with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement" cat="establishment	agency">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>  said they could not comment on why he was denied entry.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" cat="agency	establishment">FBI</a>  and  <b>airport</b> officials in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada" cat="city	seats	move	place">Las Vegas</a>  also declined comment. <br> <br>‘Never even had a speeding ticket’ <br>An aide to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Feinstein" cat="person	democrat	mayor	senator	alumnus	advocate	woman">Sen. Dianne Feinstein</a>  later told the family that Shehadeh was on a “look-out list,” Mulligan said. Feinstein’s office confirmed Tuesday that the family contacted her, but wouldn’t comment further. <br> <br>“I said you’ve got to be joking me, he’s never even had a  <b>speeding ticket</b>,” said Mulligan, a retired  <b>math</b>  <b>teacher</b> for the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">U.S.</a>  military. “I mean, we’re Muslims, and we travel a lot. Maybe the countries we travel to are not the countries they want you to visit.” <br> <br>Once in the holding facility, Shehadeh said he was stripped of his shoes, jacket and prescribed heart  <b>medicine</b> and locked in a  <b>cell</b> with about 25 other detainees. There was one  <b>toilet</b> in the middle of the room, and access to a  <b>telephone</b> was extremely limited, he said. <br> <br>On Sunday, he was released and sent back to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_am_Main" cat="">Frankfurt</a>  on the same  <b>charter airline</b>. <br> <br>Shehadeh’s daughter Majida Shehadeh said she was glad her father made it home, but feared he wouldn’t be able to return to visit. <br> <br>“I used to be happy I moved here,” she said. “But now I can’t wait for when I leave here. The mentality is not what it was like beforehand.” <br><br><br>
