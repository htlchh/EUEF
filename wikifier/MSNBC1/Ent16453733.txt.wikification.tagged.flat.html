When she returns, Walters said, “We will all welcome her back with open arms.” <br> <br>Walters also took a moment to smooth things over with  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" cat="writer	person	alumnus	businesspeople	catholic	host	executive	candidate	participant	billionaire">The Donald</a> , who got all riled up when O’Donnell said on “The View” that he had been “bankrupt so many times.” <br> <br>“ABC has asked me to say this just to clarify things, and I will quote: ‘Donald Trump has never filed for  <b>personal bankruptcy</b>. Several of his  <b>casino</b> companies have filed for business  <b>bankruptcies</b>. They are out of  <b>bankruptcy</b> now,”’ Walters said. <br> <br>O’Donnell and Trump have been  <b>feuding</b> since he announced last month that  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_USA" cat="show	pageant">Miss USA</a>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Conner" cat="winner	person	delegate	controversy">Tara Conner</a> , whose title had been in  <b>jeopardy</b> because of  <b>underage drinking</b>, would keep her crown.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" cat="writer	person	alumnus	businesspeople	catholic	host	executive	candidate	participant	billionaire">Trump</a>  is the owner of the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe_Organization" cat="">Miss Universe Organization</a> , which includes  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_USA" cat="show	pageant">Miss USA</a>  and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Teen_USA" cat="pageant">Miss Teen USA</a> . <br> <br>The 44-year-old  <b>outspoken</b> moderator of “The View,” who joined the show in September, said Trump’s news conference with Conner had annoyed her “on a multitude of levels” and that the twice-divorced  <b>real estate</b>  <b>mogul</b> had no right to be “the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America.” <br> <br>Trump fired back, calling O’Donnell a “loser” and a “bully,” among other insults, in various media interviews. <br> <br>He is the host of NBC’s “The Apprentice,” which begins its new season Sunday. <br><br><br>
