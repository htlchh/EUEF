Evolving presidential preferences <br>How will  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">American</a>  voters compensate in the next search for a president? <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington" cat="recipient	member	farmer	chancellor	congressman	person	president	officer	writer	planter	candidate	episcopalian	general">WASHINGTON</a>  - Now that the 38th president has been  <b>laid to rest</b>, the capital can take up the main business of 2007: trying to figure out who will be the 44th.  What type of leader does the country want? Here is my sense of it, based on talking to politicians, strategists and voters here and around the nation. <br> <br>No ideologues, please <br>There was a time when President George W. Bush’s ideological certitude was politically appealing and perhaps functionally necessary. That time has long since passed. The country is tired, even  <b>fearful</b>, of leaders with  <b>fervent</b> beliefs that seem impervious to new (or even old) facts. Voters see the war in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  as an “idea,” not a solution – and  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">Americans</a>  do not like ideas that do not work.  Voters likely will view Bush’s “surge” of troops into  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraq</a>  as new evidence of failure, and the dangers of a leader who depends on preconceived ideas. <br> <br>Serious student <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election" cat="election">Presidential elections</a>  are a never-ending series of mid-course corrections. Voters look to compensate for the leadership  <b>weaknesses</b> of the  <b>incumbent</b>. An example comes from the life and career of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford" cat="member	president	figure	leaders	survivor	person	center	personnel	episcopalian	candidate	lawyer	nominee	recipient	republican	scout	player	officer	alumnus">Gerald Ford</a> . In  <b>1976</b>, voters wanted a pure  <b>antidote</b> to Richard Nixon’s paranoid megalomania. Once  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford" cat="member	president	figure	leaders	survivor	person	center	personnel	episcopalian	candidate	lawyer	nominee	recipient	republican	scout	player	officer	alumnus">Ford</a>  pardoned  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon" cat="president	nominee	quakers	person	candidate	alumnus	officer	recipient	personnel	lawyer	senator	member	republican	figure">Nixon</a> , he could not be that candidate. Instead,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">Americans</a>  chose  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" cat="person	farmer	novelist	humanitarian	recipient	president	personnel	candidate	democrat	leaders	activist	writer	son	diplomat	senator	officer	nominee	baptists	winner	memoirists">Jimmy Carter</a> , a  <b>peanut</b>  <b>farmer</b> who had never worked in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a> , and who promised never to lie to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans" cat="">the American people</a> . The  <b>counterpoint</b> thinking continues. Voters in  <b>2008</b> are going to want someone who prides himself (or herself) on spending time in the  <b>library</b> – who has a hands-on curiosity about the details. <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a>  experience not necessary <br>Voters these days not only do not value  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." cat="state	place	district	city	capital">Washington</a>  experience – or any office-holding experience – it can make them suspicious. That is what strategists and polltakers for Sen.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh" cat="senator	secretary	alumnus	person	democrat	episcopalian	lawyer">Evan Bayh</a>  found when they studied whether he should run for president. They found that his remarkably deep resume – the son of a  <b>senator</b>, he was the “boy governor” of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana" cat="state">Indiana</a>  before going to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" cat="house">Senate</a>  – was as handicap.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">Americans</a>  always are dubious about the capital, but that sentiment seems  <b>particularly</b> strong.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh" cat="senator	secretary	alumnus	person	democrat	episcopalian	lawyer">Bayh</a>  decided not to run. “`Washington’ doesn’t make the case,” said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pfeiffer" cat="person	personnel	alumnus">Dan Pfeiffer</a> , who worked for  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_Bayh" cat="candidate	senator	farmer	person	survivor	member	alumnus	democrat	soldier	lawyer">Bayh</a> . <br> <br>No more  <b>boomer</b> obsessions <br>Not all  <b>elections</b> are about change, but  <b>2008</b> will be.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" cat="state	country	colony	nation	establishment	member">Americans</a>  are moderately upbeat about the country’s prospects, but  <b>deeply</b>  <b>worried</b> about the world – and they have come to realize that they can’t separate one from the other. One thing for sure, says Pfeiffer, voters are tired of arguing about the  <b>culture</b> of the 1960s and other Boomer issues.  “There is a sense that  <b>the 2004 election</b> was too much about who did or did not do what in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam" cat="state	country">Vietnam</a> ,” said Pfeiffer, referring to the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_presidential_campaign,_2004" cat="campaign">Bush campaign</a>  against  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry" cat="senator	person	lawyer	recipient	alumnus	attorney	activist	officer	democrat	politician	survivor	candidate	issue	personnel	brat	nominee">Sen.
