His secretary said the security adviser, a close aide to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki" cat="person	politician	leaders	muslim">al-Maliki</a> , was in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najaf" cat="city	place	establishment">Najaf</a>  and would not return until later. <br> <br>Chants of ‘Muqtada’ <br>Al-Faroon said there were 14  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq" cat="state	country	monarchy">Iraqi</a>  officials, including himself and another  <b>prosecutor</b>, as well as three  <b>hangmen</b> present for the  <b>execution</b>.
