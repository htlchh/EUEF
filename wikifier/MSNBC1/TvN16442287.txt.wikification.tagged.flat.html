Up your  <b>ante</b>!  <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant" cat="antioxidant	chemical">Antioxidants</a>  are naturally occurring compounds found in  <b>plant</b> based foods.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant" cat="antioxidant	chemical">Antioxidants</a>  help the body fight many serious conditions, including  <b>cancer</b> and  <b>heart disease</b>, by thwarting the action of harmful  <b>free radicals</b>. According to a study published in the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Journal_of_Clinical_Nutrition" cat="">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</a> ,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2006" cat="">July 2006</a> , the following foods are among the richest in  <b>antioxidants</b>. Go out of your way to incorporate them into your daily  <b>diet</b>. <br> <br>1.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry" cat="names	species">Blackberries</a>  <br>2.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut" cat="plant	nut">Walnuts</a>  <br>3.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_strawberry" cat="">Strawberries</a>  <br>4.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artichoke" cat="vegetable	plant	words">Artichokes</a>    <br>5.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry" cat="">Cranberries</a>  <br>6.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry" cat="names">Raspberries</a>  <br>7.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry" cat="plant">Blueberries</a>  <br>8.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clove" cat="additive	ingredient	plant	spice">Cloves</a> , ground <br> <br>4. Incorporate  <b>whole grains</b> <br> <b>2007</b> is the year to stop buying refined, white  <b>starch</b>. Instead, embrace  <b>brown rice</b>,  <b>whole wheat</b>  <b>pasta</b>,  <b>whole grain</b>  <b>bread</b> and other healthy  <b>grain</b> varieties like  <b>millet</b>,  <b>faro</b>, and amaranth.  <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning" cat="">Learn</a>  how to buy the right  <b>bread</b>! Many consumers believe they're buying the right type of  <b>bread</b> but are often confused. According to a  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Sidle" cat="character	scientist	adoptee	person	detective">Sara</a>  Lee  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Beverage" cat="">Food & Beverage</a>  survey, 73% of consumers who were asked what type of  <b>bread</b> they had in the house said "whole wheat bread," but after checking the label realized that they mistakenly thought "enriched wheat" meant  <b>whole grain</b>. <br> <br>Look a "whole" lot closer at labels in the  <b>bread</b>  <b>aisle</b> - it must say 100% Whole Wheat or 100% Whole Grain, or list the word WHOLE as one of the first ingredients on the label. <br> <br>5.   Slow the pace - lose fat on your waist  <br>In an interesting  <b>experiment</b> that was presented at the  <b>2006</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference" cat="conference">Annual Scientific Meeting</a>  a NAASO, women were invited to eat a  <b>pasta</b> lunch on two different days. On one day, the women were given a small  <b>spoon</b> and asked to take small bites, put the  <b>spoon</b> down between bites, and chew each bite at least 15 times. On the second day, the women were given a large  <b>spoon</b> and asked to eat as quickly as possible without stopping between bites. On both occasions, the women ate until they felt  <b>comfortably</b> full. When researchers measured how many  <b>calories</b> the women ate, they found that women ate 67 more  <b>calories</b> when they ate quickly than when they ate slowly. Although this may not sound like much,  <b>calories</b> add up.  <br> <br>An additional 134  <b>calories</b> per day, means 48,910  <b>calories</b> per year…. that's potentially 14  <b>pounds</b> (lost or gained!). <br> <br>For more information on  <b>healthy eating</b>, visit nutrition expert, Joy Bauer’s website at www.joybauernutrition.com  <br> <br><br><br>
