Va. <br> <br>As it turned out, 12 of the 13 miners never made it out alive. <br> <br>In  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia" cat="state">West Virginia</a>  Tuesday,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randal_McCloy" cat="">Randal McCloy</a> , the lone survivor of the disaster, joined the families of the  <b>12 men</b> who died  <b>—</b> to remember them and the  <b>nightmare</b> that began one year ago. <br> <br>"I'm just sick when I think  <b>—</b> every day when I think how those men had to die and it makes me sick," says Debbie Hamner whose husband died in the mine. <br> <br>Since  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago,_West_Virginia" cat="community">Sago</a> , both  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia" cat="state">West Virginia</a>  and the  <b>federal government</b> have passed new mine  <b>safety</b> laws. But in the mines themselves, little has changed. <br> <br>There's still no  <b>better way</b> to communicate with miners below ground; <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless" cat="">Wireless communications</a>  won't be required until  <b>2009</b>; <br>Electronic  <b>tracking systems</b> for miners are still on the  <b>drawing board</b>; <br>Underground emergency safe rooms are still not required by  <b>law</b>; and <br>Mines have another year to position more rescue teams. <br>Davitt McAteer is a mine  <b>safety</b> expert who once ran the government's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_Safety_and_Health_Administration" cat="">Mine Safety and Health Administration</a>  and led  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia" cat="state">West Virginia</a> 's  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster" cat="disaster">Sago Mine</a>  investigation. <br> <br>"We  <b>need to</b> have a way to communicate with trapped miners," McAteer says. "We  <b>need to</b> protect trapped miners until we can get to them, and we  <b>need to</b> have a way that we can provide them with the breathing apparatus and the air system so they can stay alive."   <br> <br>What has changed in mine safety since the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago,_West_Virginia" cat="community">Sago</a>  tragedy:   <br> <br> <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improve" cat="">Improved</a>  emergency procedures and training is now required; <br>There are more federal mine inspectors and tougher fines for  <b>safety</b> violations; and <br>Mines must now  <b>notify</b> the  <b>federal government</b> within 15 minutes of an accident. <br>Still not required, though are underground emergency safe rooms. <br> <br>The  <b>union</b> representing many of the nation's 73,000  <b>coal miners</b> says it's a sign of priorities. <br> <br>"There's still just an attitude out there that production comes first and  <b>safety</b> is a convenient thing and it comes second," says Dennis O'Dell of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Mine_Workers" cat="worker	miner">United Mine Workers of America</a> . <br> <br>These are boom times for the  <b>coal industry</b>, producing a record 1.17 billion tons of  <b>coal</b> in 2006, but also the highest death toll in 11 years. <br><br><br>
