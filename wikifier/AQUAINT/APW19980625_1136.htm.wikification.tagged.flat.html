It was not clear where the  <b>airliner</b> was destined. <br><br> There was no immediate  <b>confirmation</b> of the report. <br><br> The plane's  <b>captain</b>, who noticed the  <b>theft</b>, sent a  distress call   that  <b>went</b> unanswered by  <b>airport</b> officials.  Security   personnel on duty later said said they were unable to capture the culprits because their only  <b>security vehicle</b> had been taken away for  <b>routine maintenance</b>. <br><br> In another incident last week involving an unidentified  <b>passenger jet</b>,  <b>landing gear</b> worth dlrs 1 million was stripped from while the plane was waiting to take off, the  <b>newspaper</b> said.
