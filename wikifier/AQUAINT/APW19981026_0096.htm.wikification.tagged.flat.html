   Report:   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" cat="nation	member	country	state">South Africa</a>   n truth panel to condemn  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a> <br><br> A panel probing  apartheid  -era abuses has accused the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">African National Congress</a>    of  human rights   violations, including  torture   and  bomb   attacks, the state  broadcaster   said Monday. <br><br> The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a> , which led the struggle against  white rule   and now is in power, previously has acknowledged it was  <b>told</b> to expect implication in right violations. <br><br>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa)" cat="event	organisation">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a>    will release its final report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday. The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security services. <br><br>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" cat="nation	member	country	state">South African</a>  Broadcasting Corp.   radio said it had been leaked a "preliminary document'' which condemns the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a>  as politically and morally responsible for gross  <b>human rights violations</b> during and after the fall of  <b>apartheid</b>. <br><br> An  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a>  spokesman,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thabo_Mbeki" cat="president	person	member	activist">Thabo</a>  Masebe, said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance "informing us of its intention to implicate the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a>  in gross  <b>human rights violations</b>.'' <br><br> Commission officials could not  <b>immediately</b> be  <b>reached</b> for comment. <br><br> The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">ANC</a>  was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with  commissioners   earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed. <br><br> The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the planting of   <b>land mines</b>   on border farms, abuses at its military camps in  Angola  and bombings. <br><br> (djw) <br><br>
