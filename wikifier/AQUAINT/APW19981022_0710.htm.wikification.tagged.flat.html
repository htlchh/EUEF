     <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" cat="country	state">Swiss</a>    government eyes shutting down  <b>nuclear power plants</b><br><br> The  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Switzerland" cat="politics">Swiss government</a>  Thursday announced that it is planning the country's eventual exit from   <b>nuclear power</b>  , saying it wants to support instead  hydroelectric plants  . <br><br> But   <b>environmental campaigners</b>   criticized the lack of a  <b>timeframe</b> for closing the country's  four nuclear power plants  . <br><br>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official" cat="occupation	position	title">Government officials</a>  will work with representatives of the  power industry  , environmental groups and local governments to discuss a timetable and removal of   <b>nuclear waste</b>  , a government statement said. It is unrealistic to build more  power stations   because of environmental concerns, the government has said. <br><br> Should the discussions between concerned parties fail to produce an agreed timetable, the federal  cabinet   will make the decision, said the statement. <br><br> "We have set out on a new course,'' said Federal Energy Minister   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Leuenberger" cat="person	member">Moritz Leuenberger</a>   . "Details have yet to be decided.'' <br><br> In a related move, the  <b>federal cabinet</b> ordered  <b>energy</b> officials to draw up a discussion paper on changing laws governing the domestic  electricity   market. <br><br> The government envisages the creation of a  <b>national company</b> to own the power  infrastructure  . <br><br> A  <b>timeframe</b> for carrying out   <b>liberalization</b>   of the  <b>electricity market</b> itself remains to be determined, the  <b>cabinet</b> said. <br><br> The  <b>cabinet</b> said it wants to support  <b>hydroelectric plants</b>. It ordered a study of the possibility of   <b>tax</b> breaks  for  <b>hydroelectric plants</b> and how to  <b>encourage</b> upgrades of those plants. <br><br>
