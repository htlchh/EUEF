    Astronomers   Spot Storm on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Mars</a> <br><br> WASHINGTON (AP) -- A  cyclone   four times the size of   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" cat="colony	state">Texas</a>    raged across the northern  <b>polar region</b> of the  <b>planet</b>   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Mars</a>    last month, according to  space telescope   views of the  <b>red planet</b>. <br><br> <br><br> The   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Telescope_Science_Institute" cat="">Space Telescope Science Institute</a>    announced today that the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" cat="satellite	experiment	accident	project">Hubble Space Telescope</a>    on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_27" cat="days">April 27</a>  spotted an immense   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian" cat="entity">Martian</a>    storm cloud, made up of water  ice  , that was 1,100 miles long and 900 wide. <br><br> <br><br> Bands of clouds spiraled in a  <b>counterclockwise</b> motion around a 200-mile  <b>wide eye</b> in the center of the storm, taking on a shape that resembled  hurricanes   on   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="planet">Earth</a>   ,  <b>astronomers</b> said. <br><br> <br><br> The storm occurred during the summer in Mars' northern hemisphere. It came after seasonal warming  evaporated   the  carbon dioxide    ice sheet   that  <b>caps</b> the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian" cat="entity">Martian</a>  north pole   during part of the year. <br><br> <br><br> Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm spotted 20 years ago by the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_program" cat="program	mission">Viking Orbiter</a>    spacecraft. <br><br> <br><br>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy" cat="astrophysics">Astronomers</a>  used a  wide field planetary camera   on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" cat="satellite	experiment	accident	project">Hubble</a>  to  <b>photograph</b>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" cat="planet">Mars</a>  during the  <b>planet</b>'s  <b>closest approach</b> to  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" cat="planet">Earth</a>  in  <b>nearly</b> eight years. <br><br> <br><br> Two pictures, taken six hours apart on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_27" cat="days">April 27</a> , showed that the storm moved slightly eastward. In the second picture, the storm appeared to be in the process of breaking up. <br><br> <br><br> Later pictures by the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" cat="satellite	experiment	accident	project">Hubble</a>   <b>camera</b> failed to find the storm, and astronomers said it could have been a short-lived  phenomenon . <br><br>
