   Prosecutor: Botha may still stand trial<br><br> A  prosecutor   on Friday left open the possibility that former apartheid President   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Willem_Botha" cat="">P.W. Botha</a>    would be put on trial for abuses committed during  white rule  . <br><br>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor" cat="profession	prosecutor	occupation">Prosecutor</a>  Jan D'Oliveira said he currently has  <b>insufficient evidence</b> to prosecute  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Willem_Botha" cat="">Botha</a> , but that information collected by the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa)" cat="event	organisation">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a>  ( <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" cat="nation	member	country	state">South Africa</a> )  , which investigated  <b>apartheid-era</b> abuses, still must be evaluated to ascertain whether charges would ultimately be brought. <br><br> Last month, the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_reconciliation_commission" cat="right">Truth Comission</a>  issued a landmark report on its findings. It said  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Willem_Botha" cat="">Botha</a>  had ordered the  <b>1987</b> bombing of the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress" cat="organisation	party	movement">African National Congress</a>   '  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" cat="capital	port	city	place">London</a>  headquarters and the  <b>1988</b> bombing of a   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg" cat="capital	city	place">Johannesburg</a>    building housing an  <b>anti-apartheid</b> group. <br><br> When  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Willem_Botha" cat="">Botha</a>  was head of  <b>state</b> in the 1980s,  <b>thousands</b> of people were detained without trial. Many were tortured and others killed. <br><br> The commission can grant   <b>amnesty</b>   to those who  <b>fully</b> confess to politically motivated abuses committed during  <b>apartheid</b>.  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Willem_Botha" cat="">Botha</a>  has said he has nothing to confess and has not sought  <b>amnesty</b>. <br><br> Earlier this year,  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Willem_Botha" cat="">Botha</a>  was convicted of  contempt of court   for refusing to testify before the commission. He was handed a suspended  <b>one-year</b> jail sentence and a 10,000  rand  (dlrs 5,700) fine. He has appealed the decision. <br><br> (sapa-aos) <br><br>
