Could you advise? <br><br> Also, I fully support his request for the media to report on the  lifestyle   of former  executives   of the failed  banks   and  finance   companies. We all know too well that these people will not be punished legally because of the inefficiency of the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Thailand" cat="banks">Bank of Thailand</a>    in collecting evidence against them and of our  justice system   in delivering  <b>timely</b> justice. It is the media's job to discover how these guys are better off after destroying our country, and it is the  Thai people  's job to socially punish them. <br><br> I would like to propose that  newspapers   and  TV stations  play up this issue (the continued luxurious lifestyle of the former executives) to attract more public attention, and I will give them Bt20,000 of my hard-earned salary with my full blessing. <br><br> Artit Krichphiphat (An ordinary  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language" cat="language">Thai</a>   <b>citizen</b> who wants to see the right things get done) Editor's note: Khun Mechai will organise a  <b>seminar</b> on the plan on  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_7" cat="days">June 7</a>  at the  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone" cat="group">Telephone</a>  Organisation of Thailand at 10 am.
