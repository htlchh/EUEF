The area is about 60 miles southwest of  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska" cat="place	city	settlement">Anchorage</a> . <br><br> <br><br> The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday. <br><br> <br><br> His only visible wound was  <b>a single bite</b> to the head, said Bruce Bartley, a spokesman for the  <b>state</b> Division of Wildlife Conservation. <br><br> <br><br> State and federal  <b>wildlife</b> officials were  <b>looking</b> for the  <b>bear</b> involved in the attack. If the  <b>bear</b> is judged to pose a continuing threat to humans it may be killed. <br><br> <br><br> Troopers said Cates' .280-caliber  rifle   and two spent  <b>shell</b> casings were found near the body, along with traces of  <b>blood</b> that suggest that Cates may have wounded the  <b>animal</b>. <br><br> <br><br> "We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if there were two real shots,'' Bartley said. <br><br> <br><br> Cates' death is the first fatal  <b>bear</b> mauling in  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" cat="state">Alaska</a>  since Feb. 8, 1998, when  Audelio Luis  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortes_Generales" cat="parliament">Cortes</a>   , 40, was killed while working on a  seismic   crew in the   <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson_River" cat="river">Swanson River</a>     oil field   near  Kenai . Cortes also died from a single head bite. <br><br>
