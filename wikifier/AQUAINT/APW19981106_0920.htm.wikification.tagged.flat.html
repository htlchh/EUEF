Virtually all of the country's  <b>electricity</b> now comes from   <b>hydroelectric plants</b>  . <br><br> Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be mixed to produce hydrogen,  nitrogen   and carbon dioxide. <br><br>  <a class="wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsk_Hydro" cat="company">Norsk Hydro</a>  wants to build the  <b>plant</b> at Karmoey, an  <b>island</b> about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of  Oslo . <br><br>
